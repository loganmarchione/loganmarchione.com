# Interview stuff

I end up referencing this materal often, so I thought I'd publish it here.

# Questions for interviewer

## Purpose
* When asked "Do you have any questions for us?", you don't need to mumble like you're not prepared.
* These questions are more geared towards tech/IT white-collar (i.e., cubicle) type jobs in the USA.

## Instructions
* Print this out and bring it with you to an interview.
* Make sure you actually write down the answers you're given, don't just nod your head and say "Mmhmmm".
* Comments and notes are _in italics_.

## Questions

* How are you funded? _Capital, stocks, private investment, etc..._
* Are you profitable? If not, what is your plan to become profitable? _This mainly applies to startups._
* What is the company's growth plan for the next 1 year? Next 5 years?
* Do you outsource work? If so, what percentage? _Not specifically overseas, but even to contractors._
* Can you tell me about the company culture?

* I highly recommend reading [this](https://www.getrichslowly.org/salary-negotiation/) before discussing salary (specifically the five tips)
    1. Postpone salary negotiations until after you've been offered a job
    2. Let the other side make the first offer
    3. When you hear the offer, repeat the top value, then be silent
    4. Counter the offer with a researched response
    5. Cinch the deal, then some more
* Do you give formal performance reviews? If so, how often?
* How do you reward tenure?
