# Interview stuff

I end up referencing this materal often, so I thought I'd publish it here.

# Questions for interviewer

## Purpose
* When asked "Do you have any questions for us?", you don't need to mumble like you're not prepared.
* These questions are more geared towards tech/IT white-collar (i.e., cubicle) type jobs in the USA.

## Instructions
* Print this out and bring it with you to an interview.
* You don't need to ask every question. Use your best judgement.
* Make sure you actually write down the answers you're given, don't just nod your head and say "Mmhmmm".
* Comments and notes are _in italics_.
* Remember that the company isn't just interviewing you, **you're interviewing them**! You're about to give them years of your life, blood, sweat, and tears. Be thorough and don't sell yourself short!

## Questions

### About the (potential) company (may be best to direct this to HR)

* How are you funded? _Capital, stocks, private investment, etc..._
* How do you make money? _Try to explain this to a friend and see if it makes sense to them._
* Are you profitable? If not, what is your runway and what is your plan to become profitable? _This mainly applies to startups._
* What is the company's growth plan for the next 1 year? Next 5 years?
* What is your company's competitive advantage?
* Do you outsource work? If so, what percentage? _Not specifically overseas, but even to contractors._

  * Do you provide open offices, personal offices, or cubicles?
  * Is there a dress code?
  * Do you allow remote work?
* Will I need to sign a non-compete or non-disclosure agreement?
* Is there a separate tech and management career track?
* Can I contribute to FOSS projects? _Try to see if they have a claim to your IP._
* Does this company support FOSS projects? _Either with money or developer hours._
* Do employees speak at conferences?

### About the (potential) position

* Why is this position open? _Try to determine if the position has high turnover or if it's unnecessarily stressful._
* Why is the company hiring an outsider over promoting an existing employee? _This may not apply in all scenarios._
* Can you describe a typical day in this position? What about a typical week?
* What would you expect me to accomplish in the first 60 to 90 days? What about the first year?
* How is the success of the person in this position to be measured? _Do you work on a quota (e.g., number of closed tickets per week), or are your goals less quantifiable?_

### About your (potential) manager

* How long have you been with the company?
* How would you describe your management style? _If they use the words "hands-on" or "micro", run the other way._
* What is your team's biggest challenge right now? _They'll probably say "Not enough staff", since they're hiring. Ask for their second biggest challenge._
* Is there anything in particular that frustrates you? Anything from the culture, to a particular project. _Try to learn what frustrates them, because you need to show them how you can solve their problems._
* What is the number one goal/project you'd like to achieve/complete in the next year or two?
* Do you do one-on-ones?
* What do your employees do in their free time? _This not only shows that the employees have lives outside of work, but it shows that their manager knows them on a personal level._
* What excites you personally about coming into work?
* What is it that has kept you working for this company for so long?

* Do you use infrastructure as code?
* What kind of disaster recovery systems do you use?

  * Do you give annual salary increases? If so, what was last year's median raise on your team (in percent)?
  * Do you give bonuses? If so, how often and how is the amount determined?
  * Do you rank employees against one another when determining raises and bonuses?

  * In-office snacks/food?
  * In-office causal dress code?
  * Charity donation matching?

### Time off/PTO

* How frequently can I work from home?
* How frequently will I be expected to come into the office?
* Will the company pay for electronics/office equipment? If so, who owns that equipment?
* How do you feel about BYOD?
