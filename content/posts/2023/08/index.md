# Introduction

I've been using a [WASD CODE 87-key mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX Clear switches](https://www.wasdkeyboards.com/code-v3-87-key-mechanical-keyboard-cherry-mx-clear.html) since 2017.

I actually have two of them (one for when I used to work in the office), but have been looking more at ergonomic keyboards and decided to make the jump to split keyboards.
