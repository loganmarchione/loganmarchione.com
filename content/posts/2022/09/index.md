# Introduction

I only have one complaint about my [10-inch mini-rack](/2021/01/homelab-10-mini-rack): the self has a lip on the front that bends downward (for structural stability), but this takes away from usable height of the shelf. Instead of being 1U in height (1.75-inches), there is only about 1.5-inches to work with.

I was looking to replace the original shelf I purchased, so that I could make room for a [UniFi Switch Lite 16 PoE](https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-network-switching/products/usw-lite-16-poe), which is 1.72-inches tall.

# Rack standards

## 19-inch racks

[19-inch racks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19-inch_rack) are the most common. They measure:
* 19-inches wide (including the "ears")
* 18-5/16 (18.3125) inches center-to-center on post-holes
* 17-3/4 (17.75) inches opening width between posts

## 10-inch racks

The 10-inch rack (aka "half-rack") isn't a standard (that I could find). As such, equipment advertised as 10-inches or half-rack *might* not all be compatible.

10-inch racks are much more common outside the US (I'm not sure why). There are tons of companies selling 10-inch racks and accessories.

# Shelves

I tried to only purchase products with reasonable shipping costs (e.g., not paying $100 to ship a $10 metal shelf). I purchased the following products (plus the original shelf with the metal lip).

# Comparison

Although I only need three shelves, for comparison sake, I removed the patch panel so you could see all four shelves at once. They are ordered top-to-bottom just like the table above.

The BLANK shelf is the widest, by only a few millimeters. The cage nuts I'm using allow for the rack to expand/contract by the few millimeters I need to make them all fit.
