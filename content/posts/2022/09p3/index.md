# Introduction

I only have one complaint about my [10-inch mini-rack](/2021/01/homelab-10-mini-rack): the self has a lip on the front that bends downward (for structural stability), but this takes away from usable height of the shelf. Instead of being 1U in height (1.75-inches), there is only about 1.5-inches to work with.

I was looking to replace the original shelf I purchased, so that I could make room for a [UniFi Switch Lite 16 PoE](https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-network-switching/products/usw-lite-16-poe), which is 1.72-inches tall.

# Rack standards

## 19-inch racks

[19-inch racks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19-inch_rack) are the most common. They measure:
* 19-inches wide (including the "ears")
* 18-5/16 (18.3125) inches center-to-center on post-holes
* 17-3/4 (17.75) inches opening width between posts

## 10-inch racks

The 10-inch rack (aka "half-rack") [isn't a standard](http://rtsound.net/half-rack-compatible-equipment/) (that I could find). As such, all equipment advertised as 10-inches or half-rack *might* not be compatible.

10-inch racks are much more common outside the US (I'm not sure why). There are tons of companies selling 10-inch racks and accessories outside the US.

Inside the US, the only 10-inch racks/accessories I could find were specifically from audio/video websites, so I'm assuming that form-factor is more popular in the audio/video space (again, I'm not sure why).

# Shelves

I was able to find a few shelves on Amazon and eBay. I tried to only purchase products with reasonable shipping costs (e.g., not paying $100 to ship a $10 metal shelf). I purchased the following products (plus the original shelf with the metal lip).

| Brand           | Part Number         | Purchase location                                                        | Price (USD)                          | Price (USD) shipping | Shipping time     | Usable height | Usable width | Usable depth |
|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| Digitus         | DN-10-TRAY-1-B      | [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/295163651736)                            | $24.20                               | $8.19                | XX days (from IT) |
| Digitus         | DN-10-TRAY-2-B      | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XJXKX4R)                           | $28.62                               | Free                 | 10 days (from UK) |
| Middle Atlantic | HR-UMS1-5.5         | [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/195155991454)                            | $39.99                               | Free                 | 3 days (from US)  |
| Intellinet      | 714839              | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078WCBFFM)                           | $15.95 (at time of purchase in 2021) | Free                 | 9 days (from UK)  |

# Comparison

Although I only needed three shelves, for comparison sake, I removed the patch panel so you could see all four shelves at once. They are ordered top-to-bottom just like the table above.

The BLANK shelf is the widest, by only a few millimeters. The cage nuts I'm using allow for the rack to expand/contract by the few millimeters I need to make them all fit.

If I had to pick a winner, it would be the Digitus DN-10-TRAY-1-B, simply because it has the slimmest profile, allowing the most height/width/depth for equipment.

# Conclusion

If you're in the US, your best bet is to scour eBay and Amazon for the phrase "half-rack" and find options with low/free shipping. Other than that, you can overpay for audio/video equipment. I will probably keep my hodgepodge of different shelves as-is for now.
