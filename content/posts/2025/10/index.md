# Introduction

I know I'm about five years too late too the party, but I finally setup [Proxmox Backup Server (PBS)](https://www.proxmox.com/en/products/proxmox-backup-server/overview).

Right now, I have 10 servers inside my Proxmox Virtual Environment (VE) setup, made up of a mix of virtual machines (VMs) and LXC containers (LXCs). I'm using the [built-in Proxmox VE backup system](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Backup_and_Restore) to backup my VMs/LXCs to my NAS. This results in about 250GB of backups, which happen once a week. I keep 12 weeks of backups, so that's 3TB of backups on my NAS. Even if nothing changes week-to-week on a single server, the entire machine is getting backed up every week, taking up the full amount of space.

Proxmox Backup Server is a separate backup solution that has a [ton of features](https://www.proxmox.com/en/products/proxmox-backup-server/features):

- designed specifically to work with Proxmox VE
- open-source
- written in Rust (so it's memory safe)
- free (as in freedom and beer), though they do have a [paid support plan](https://www.proxmox.com/en/products/proxmox-backup-server/pricing) (but I'm unsure why it's so much more expensive than [the Proxmox VE support plan](https://www.proxmox.com/en/products/proxmox-virtual-environment/pricing))
- incremental backups
- deduplication
- compression
- encryption
- checksums
- granular restores (e.g., single files from a machine)

The big selling points here are incremental backups and deduplication. Incremental, meaning that there is a single, large, initial backup for each machine, and then each subsequent backup only backs up the changed files. Deduplication, meaning that files that are the same across backups are only stored once. Both of these combined can save you a *ton* of space on backups. I've read online that the deduplication ratio can be as high as 50:1 or 100:1 (as in, `ratio = original_data_size / stored_data_size`).

# Hardware

I was looking for the following things in a PBS box:

- small (needs to fit in my [mini-rack](/2021/01/homelab-10-mini-rack/))
- x86 (to run PBS)
- DDR4/DDR5 memory (ECC if possible)
- fanless (one less thing to dust)
- Intel NICs
- M.2 storage

It's easy to find all of that in cheap Chinese mini PCs on Amazon, except ECC support. [Error correcting code (ECC) memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECC_memory) is special memory that has an extra chip on the RAM stick that is used for parity bits to detect and correct bit-flips in memory. It's generally used on servers, and hardly ever used on consumer PCs (especially mini PCs). I was also trying to find something that was from a relatively well-known manufacturer that wouldn't burn my house down. The Chinese mini PCs worry me, because they're all no-name brands that disappear from Amazon after a few months (or provide no support if they don't disappear).

## Comparison

I must have looked at hundreds or thousands of mini PCs on obscure industrial and electronics distributor websites. Below are the devices that I found in my searching.

## Purchase

I once again found myself purchasing a second [OPNsense DEC740](https://shop.opnsense.com/product/dec740-opnsense-desktop-security-appliance/) ([the last one was for my pfSense router](/2025/03/pfsense-on-the-opnsense-dec740/)). I would love to find out who OEMs these for OPNsense so I could purchase 10 of them (without OPNsense installed). I really love these little boxes, I just wish they weren't so expensive ðŸ˜….

{{< img src="20250215_002.jpg" alt="dec740" >}}

I also picked up two upgrades:

- a stick of 16GB DDR4 ECC UDIMM VLP (specifically model number MTA18ADF2G72AZ-2G6 from [Memory.net](https://memory.net/product/mta18adf2g72az-2g6-micron-1x-16gb-ddr4-2666-ecc-udimm-pc4-21300v-e-dual-rank-x8-module/)) for $84
- an industrial-grade 2TB NVMe SSD (specifically model number OM8SGP42048K2-A00 from [Mouser.com](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Kingston/OM8SGP42048K2-A00?qs=%252BICfH0Hx1eSIkRKcGCyUfA%3D%3D)) for $229

You can see my post [here](/2025/03/pfsense-on-the-opnsense-dec740/#ecc-ram-upgrade) on what the inside of the DEC740 looks like, so I won't re-hash that.

# Pre-installation

## Console settings

The serial adapter shows up as `Exar Corp. XR21B1411 UART` in Linux, and I verifed it connected to `/dev/ttyUSB0` to by using `sudo dmesg | grep tty`. I tried to use `screen` to connect to it, but after a while, the characters on the screen would get misaligned and impossible to read.

```
screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
```

I ended up using [tio](https://github.com/tio/tio), which worked great.

```
tio /dev/ttyUSB0
```

This was the BIOS that shipped with the DEC740. According to [this page](https://docs.opnsense.org/hardware/bios.html), it's up-to-date.

```
BIOS Version : 05.38.26.0025-A10.33
BIOS Build Date : 03/05/2025
Processor Type : AMD Ryzen Embedded V1500B
System Memory Speed : 2400 MHz
```

At boot, you can press `ESC` once to enter the BIOS "Front Page" (you need to very quick with this first `ESC`).

```

### ECC error injection

At the Front Page, go to `Setup Utility`, then `AMD CBS`, then `UMC Common Options`, then `DDR4 Common Options`, then `Common RAS`. Then, set the `Disable Memory Error Injection` to `False` (since we want to test ECC memory errors).

### Console/serial settings

These settings are required to get Linux to boot. If you want to go back to OPNsense at some point, you'll probably need to change these back.

At the Front Page, go to `Setup Utility`, then `AMD CBS`, then `FCH Common Options`, then `Uart Configuration Options`. Then, set the `Uart 0 Legacy Options` to `COM1 0x3F8`.

## Memory test

I always test my memory, but since this was ECC memory, I needed a program to test the ECC functionality. Apparently, MemTest86+ (the open-source tool), [doesn't support testing ECC](https://github.com/memtest86plus/memtest86plus/discussions/248) yet. MemTest86 Pro (the closed-source tool) does [support ECC injection](https://www.memtest86.com/ecc.htm), so that's what I went with.

For reference, here is the [MemTest86 Pro configuration file](https://www.memtest86.com/tech_configuring-memtest.html) called `mt86.cfg` that I was using.

```
ECCPOLL=1
ECCINJECT=1
LANG=en-US
AUTOMODE=1
AUTOREPORT=1
AUTOREPORTFMT=HTML
EXITMODE=0
CONSOLEONLY=1
```

At the Front Page, go to `Boot Manager`. I was able to boot from a USB flash drive containing MemTest86 Pro and it started the test right away.

```

You will see errors in MemTest86 Pro, since it's injecting ECC errors to test the ECC functionality. I left MemTest86 Pro to run for about 6 hours and came back to this (report below).

# Installing Proxmox Backup Server

This is where things get difficult. I found [this](https://wiki.junicast.de/en/junicast/review/opnsense_dec740) really helpful page by Jochen Demmer, along with this accompanying [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w33ijSZEEUc). In it, Jochen describes how he tried to install Proxmox, but was unable to get it to boot. I even emailed Jochen, but he had no further information than what was in the post and video. He actually ended up pulling the NVMe SSD out of the DEC740 and installing it in a different PC to write Proxmox to it.


Armed with that information, I wrote the [PBS ISO](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads/proxmox-backup-server/iso) directly to a USB flash drive using `dd` and immediately ran into the same issue as Jochen (not sure what I expected to happen). The error is below, nothing else on the screen. I suspect this is something to do with the lack of a graphics output on this board and the fact that I'm using serial.

```
error: file `/boot/' not found.
```

I then wrote [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html) to the USB flash drive and copied the PBS ISO to the mounted directory. Sure enough, Ventoy booted without issue (if you don't set the two `Uart Configuration Options` in the BIOS from above, this won't work)

Here, the only one that worked was choosing `Advanced Options`.

After showing the Linux boot log (progress!), I had to press `Ctrl+D` two separate times, and then the PBS serial installer started.

{{< img src="20251013_001.png" alt="proxmox serial installer" >}}

I'm unsure why Ventoy worked, when writing the PBS ISO directly to a USB flash drive didn't. A few notes:

- I was unable to set the [`nomodeset`](https://pbs.proxmox.com/docs/using-the-installer.html#nomodeset-kernel-param) kernel parameter, since I never got to the boot menu in the first place.
- The installation [documation](https://pbs.proxmox.com/docs/using-the-installer.html) says that the `Serial Console Debug Mode` "sets up the Linux kernel to use the (first) serial port of the machine for in- and output", but I was unsure how to trigger this manually.
- I tried to edit the PBS ISO on the USB flash drive to change boot settings in `/boot/grub/grub.cfg`, but the filesystem seemed to be read-only, so I was unable to change anything (no matter how I wrote the ISO or how I mounted it).

## Boot issues

If you install Proxmox and reboot, you'll end up with some sort of boot issue, like a kernel panic.

The problem is that Ventoy in `grub2 mode` adds an extra kernel parameter `rdinit=/vtoy/vtoy` to the bootloader. This is documented [here](https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/ventoy-install-of-proxmox-8-1-halts-at-loading-initial-ramdisk.143196/), [here](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/issues/2782), and [here](https://bugzilla.proxmox.com/show_bug.cgi?id=5661). The fix is to remove it and reboot, but doing that isn't easy.

According to the [documentation](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Host_Bootloader), ZFS uses `systemd-boot`, while XFS uses GRUB.

>For EFI Systems installed with ZFS as the root filesystem systemd-boot is used, unless Secure Boot is enabled. All other deployments use the standard GRUB bootloader (this usually also applies to systems which are installed on top of Debian).

This means that the files that you need to update will depend on which bootloader you used, which is itself dependant on which filesystem you chose.

### If you're using ZFS on root

I had to boot into the `Serial Console Debug Mode` again (from Ventoy). From there, I imported the pool, then mounted it and the required directories.

```
# import the ZFS pool
# the key is the -N flag, which doesn't mount the ZFS filesystem (since we already have a / mount, we can't mount / over it)
zpool import
zpool import -f -N rpool
zpool list

# mount the zpool to /mnt
# again, we're going out of our way to not auto-mount / over top of /
zfs set mountpoint=legacy rpool/ROOT/pbs-1
mount -t zfs rpool/ROOT/pbs-1 /mnt
ls -la /mnt/etc/kernel

# mount required directoriesw
mount -t proc proc /mnt/proc
mount -t sysfs sys /mnt/sys
mount --rbind /dev /mnt/dev
mount --rbind /run /mnt/run

# create /boot/efi and mount /dev/nvme0n1p2 there
mkdir -p /mnt/boot/efi
mount /dev/nvme0n1p2 /mnt/boot/efi
```

Now, we're doing the actual `chroot`, editing the files, and [rebuilding the bootloader](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Host_Bootloader).

```
# chroot in
chroot /mnt /bin/bash

# find the files
# i think you only need to edit /etc/kernel/cmdline, but i'm editing both
grep -ir vtoy /etc

# edit the files
vi /etc/default/grub.d/installer.cfg
vi /etc/kernel/cmdline

# refresh the bootloader
proxmox-boot-tool refresh
```

Finally, we need to cleanup.

```
# set mountpoint back to / (so that we can boot later) and exit the chroot
zfs set mountpoint=/ rpool/ROOT/pbs-1
exit

# unmount
umount /mnt/boot/efi
umount /mnt/run
umount -l /mnt/dev
umount /mnt/sys
umount /mnt/proc
umount /mnt

# make sure /proc is mounted in the live environment and export the pool
mount -t proc proc /proc
zpool export rpool
reboot
```

Now, rebooting will boot right into PBS.

### If you're using XFS on root

After reboot, Proxmox didn't successfully boot, but I was able to press `e` at the boot menu.

This let me edit the `linux` line to remove `rdinit=/vtoy/vtoy`. Just keep in mind these are Emacs key-bindings, not Vim.

      Minimum Emacs-like screen editing is supported. TAB lists completions. Press Ctrl-x or F10 to boot, Ctrl-c or F2
      for a command-line or ESC to discard edits and return to the GRUB menu.
```

Once you're done, press `F10` to boot, and PBS will start, but the fix is just temporary. From here, login as `root` and edit the file `/etc/default/grub.d/installer.cfg` to remove `rdinit=/vtoy/vtoy`, then run `update-grub` to permanently update your bootloader.

```
GRUB_TERMINAL_INPUT="console serial"
GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT="gfxterm serial"
GRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND="serial --unit=0 --speed=115200"
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="$GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX console=ttyS0,115200 rdinit=/vtoy/vtoy"
```

Now, rebooting will boot right into PBS.

## Setup Proxmox Backup Server

From here, you can connect an ethernet cable to your LAN interface and setup PBS. If you're curious, here is the info about the five on-board NICs. The three RJ-45 ports are [Intel I226-V](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/drivers/net/ethernet/intel/igc/) and the two SFP+ ports are from the [AMD CPU](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/drivers/net/ethernet/amd/xgbe/).
