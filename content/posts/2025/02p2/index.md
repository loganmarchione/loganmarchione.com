# Introduction

My [APU2 is five years old now](http://localhost:1313/2019/08/pfsense-on-the-pc-engines-apu2/) and I notice that it runs slow when making changes in pfSense's web UI. The CPU is an AMD GX-412TC (from 2014) and it's running 4GB of DDR3 memory, so I guess that's to be expected. Also, I only have 500/500Mbps internet, but would like to update to 1Gbps at some point, and I'm left wondering if the APU2 could keep up with that speed. I've seen [this post](https://teklager.se/en/knowledge-base/apu2-1-gigabit-throughput-pfsense/) about routing at 1Gbps on the APU2 hardware, but I'm also running pfBlockerNG and wondering if that would affect speed.

For something as critical as a router, I didn't want to wait until it died to replace it. Thinking there would be a newer model, I went to the [PC Engines website](https://www.pcengines.ch/), only to see that they are [ending production and closing their company](https://www.pcengines.ch/eol.htm) :cry:.

{{< img src="20241107_001.png" alt="pc engines eol" >}}

This was really disheartening, but I understand the decision given the circumstances. The APU2 was a great machine that would be hard to replace.

# Hardware

I was looking for the following things in a replacement box:

- small (needs to fit in my [mini-rack](/2021/01/homelab-10-mini-rack/))
- x86 (to run pfSense)
- DDR4 memory (ECC if possible)
- fanless (one less thing to dust)
- Intel NICs
- M.2 storage

It's easy to find all of that in cheap Chinese mini PCs on Amazon, except ECC support. [Error correcting code (ECC) memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECC_memory) is special memory that has an extra chip on the stick that is used for parity bits to detect and correct bit-flips in memory. It's generally used on servers, and hardly ever used on consumer PCs (especially mini PCs). However, I was also trying to find something that was from a relatively well-known manufacturer that wouldn't burn my house down. The Chinese mini PCs worry me, because they're all no-name brands that disappear from Amazon after a few months and provide no support if they don't disappear.

## Comparison

Below are the devices that I found in my searching (the first one is the current APU2D4 that I have now).

Below are devices that I looked at, but there was one reason or another that they didn't make the cut...

- [AAEON FWS-2277](https://eshop.aaeon.com/desktop-network-appliance-sd-wan-intel-celeron-n3350-fws-2277.html) (Celeron CPU, which means no ECC support)
- [DFI EC800-AL](https://www.dfi.com/product/index/129) (Atom CPUs, but no ECC support)
- [GIGAIPC QBiX-EHLA6412-A1](https://www.gigaipc.com/en/products-detail/QBiX-EHLA6412-A1/) (Celeron CPU, which means no ECC support)
- [Jetway FBU03](https://jetwaycomputer.com/FBU03.html) (Celeron CPU, which means no ECC support)
- [Polywell Nano-N305L4](https://www.polywell.com/nano-n305l4) (i3-N305 CPU, which means no ECC support)
- [Portwell CAF-0100](https://portwell.com/products/detail.php?CUSTCHAR1=CAF-0100) (Too wide for a half-rack, IB-ECC)


## Purchase

I must have looked at hundreds or thousands of mini PCs on obscure industrial and electronics distributor websites.

The [Nexcom DNA 141](https://www.nexcomusa.com/Products/network-and-communication-solutions/cyber-security-solutions/desktop-x86-based-appliance/desktop-x86-based-appliance-dna-141) would have made the perfect router (chef's kiss), but I was unable to find a reseller/distributor. I reached out to Nexcom, but they informed me that they don't sell to individuals. When I asked about a reseller/distributor in the US, they stopped replying ðŸ¤·.

I almost ended up purchasing a Lanner NCA-1510. Funny enough, the Lanner NCA-1510A is the OEM of the Netgate SG-5100, according to a few posts ([here](https://forum.netgate.com/post/1040249), [here](https://chaos.social/@JeGr/112512006883278146), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PFSENSE/comments/1b8lg3z/comment/kttopfw/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PFSENSE/comments/93kl91/comment/e4admnm/)).

I ended up going with the Deciso DEC740, as it was the only one that had ECC memory in such a small footprint and it was easy to purchase as a non-business. To me, it's the spritual successor to the APU2 (it's almost the same size, same layout, but updated with modern hardware for modern applications). There is some really good information [here](https://wiki.junicast.de/en/junicast/review/opnsense_dec740) and [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20240407173603/https://www.deciso.com/netboard-a10-gen3/) about the DEC740 and its specifications (the second link is an Archive.org link because the URL is currently returning a 404).

Based on [this comparison](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/5050vs4304/AMD-GX-412TC-SOC-vs-AMD-Ryzen-Embedded-V1500B), the CPU in the new device should run rings around my own APU2. Plus, this device has 2x 10Gbps SFP+ ports.

{{< img src="20250203_002.png" alt="cpu comparison" >}}

I also picked up a stick of 32GB DDR4 ECC UDIMM VLP (specifically model number MTA18ADF4G72AZ-2G6 from [Memory.net](https://memory.net/product/mta18adf4g72az-2g6-micron-1x-32gb-ddr4-2666-ecc-udimm-pc4-21300v-e-dual-rank-x8-module/)) for $124. I would assume any ECC memory would work here, but it has to be UDIMM and it has to be Very Low Profile (VLP).

# Decisions

## Did I pay over $800 for a router?!

Yes. My router is arguably the most important device on my network. It protects my network from the big, bad internet. I don't mind paying for a product that can do that job silently, reliably, 24/7, now and 10 years into the future. If I amortize the $800 over 10 years, that's only $80 per year (I spend more money per year on Chipotle).

Side note - This is a week of data from my Graylog instance. This is what my router is protecting me from.

## Why pfSense?

I know that Netgate (the company that owns pfSense) has had some controversies:

- 2016: When OPNsense sense was forked from pfSense, Netgate purchased the domain OPNsense.com and [setup a parody site](https://web.archive.org/web/20160314132836/http://www.opnsense.com/) to discredit OPNsense. OPNsense had to [appeal](https://opnsense.org/opnsense-com/) to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) to get control of the domain.
- 2017: Netgate announced ([here](https://www.netgate.com/blog/pfsense-2-5-and-aes-ni) and [here](https://www.netgate.com/blog/more-on-aes-ni)) that pfSense 2.5 would require [AES-NI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set), then [walked that back in 2019](https://www.netgate.com/blog/pfsense-2-5-0-development-snapshots-now-available)
- 2017: Netgate implemented a scary-looking popup [disclaimer](https://www.netgate.com/blog/its-still-free-to-use) in order to use pfSense
- 2019: Netgate hired a developer to implement WireGuard for pfSense and then upstream the code to FreeBSD (side note - apparently the developer was [slighty crazy](https://www.theregister.com/2008/04/24/kip_macy_arrest/)). This was finished in 2020. In 2021, it was clear the code was not production-ready. Netgate gets defensive and is [called out by the WireGuard developer himself](https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/dev-commits-src-all/2021-March/004413.html). Netgate then has to do [damage control](https://www.netgate.com/blog/painful-lessons-learned-in-security-and-community).
- 2021: Netgate [announced](https://www.netgate.com/blog/announcing-pfsense-plus) a closed-source version of pfSense called pfSense Plus (which gets more love and attention from Netgate than the open-source version)
- 2023: Netgate pushed homelabbers from a free Community Edition license to pfSense Plus (called Home+Lab edition), then changed their mind and [started charging for the Home+Lab license](https://www.netgate.com/blog/addressing-changes-to-pfsense-plus-homelab)
- 2024: Netgate locked the installer for pfSense CE (the free version) [behind a login page](https://www.reddit.com/r/PFSENSE/comments/1chzp1n/comment/l29c7gw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

So, with all that said: why am I using pfSense?

To be honest, I just don't care about any of the drama above because it doesn't affect me. I don't pay for pfSense (and wouldn't with the way Netgate acts), so I don't feel like I'm "supporting" their bad behavior. I'll continue to use the free version of pfSense until they make it paid, or closed-source, then I'll switch to OPNsense. But right now, I don't feel like learning OPNsense and re-building my firewall from scratch (I just want to restore a backup and get on with life).

# Installation

The installation process couldn't have been easier. pfSense has excellent documentation, and Tom Lawrence has a [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oi02LayIIM) talking about the process of restoring from a backup (both to the same hardware, and different hardware).
