# Introduction

My [APU2 is five years old now](http://localhost:1313/2019/08/pfsense-on-the-pc-engines-apu2/) and I notice that it runs slow when making changes in pfSense's web UI. The CPU is an AMD GX-412TC (from 2014) and it's running 4GB of DDR3 memory, so I guess that's to be expected. Also, I only have 500/500Mbps internet, but would like to update to 1Gbps at some point, and I'm left wondering if the APU2 could keep up with that speed. I've seen [this post](https://teklager.se/en/knowledge-base/apu2-1-gigabit-throughput-pfsense/) about routing at 1Gbps on the APU2 hardware, but I'm also running pfBlockerNG and wondering if that would affect speed.

For something as critical as a router, I didn't want to wait until it died to replace it. Thinking there would be a newer model, I went to the [PC Engines website](https://www.pcengines.ch/), only to see that they are [ending production and closing their company](https://www.pcengines.ch/eol.htm) :cry:.

{{< img src="20241107_001.png" alt="pc engines eol" >}}

This was really disheartening, but I understand the decision given the circumstances. The APU2 was a great machine that would be hard to replace.

# Hardware

I was looking for the following things in a replacement box:

- small (needs to fit in my [mini-rack](/2021/01/homelab-10-mini-rack/))
- x86 (to run pfSense)
- DDR4 memory (ECC if possible)
- fanless (one less thing to dust)
- Intel NICs
- M.2 storage

It's easy to find all of that in cheap Chinese mini PCs on Amazon, except ECC support. [Error correcting code (ECC) memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECC_memory) is special memory that has an extra chip on the stick that is used for parity bits to detect and correct bit-flips in memory. It's generally used on servers, and hardly ever used on consumer PCs (especially mini PCs). However, I was also trying to find something that was from a relatively well-known manufacturer that wouldn't burn my house down. The Chinese mini PCs worry me, because they're all no-name brands that disappear from Amazon after a few months and provide no support if they don't disappear.

## Comparison

Below are the devices that I found in my searching (the first one is the current APU2D4 that I have now).

Below are devices that I looked at, but there was one reason or another that they didn't make the cut...

- [AAEON FWS-2277](https://eshop.aaeon.com/desktop-network-appliance-sd-wan-intel-celeron-n3350-fws-2277.html) (Celeron CPU, which means no ECC support)
- [DFI EC800-AL](https://www.dfi.com/product/index/129) (Atom CPUs, but no ECC support)
- [GIGAIPC QBiX-EHLA6412-A1](https://www.gigaipc.com/en/products-detail/QBiX-EHLA6412-A1/) (Celeron CPU, which means no ECC support)
- [Jetway FBU03](https://jetwaycomputer.com/FBU03.html) (Celeron CPU, which means no ECC support)
- [Polywell Nano-N305L4](https://www.polywell.com/nano-n305l4) (i3-N305 CPU, which means no ECC support)
- [Portwell CAF-0100](https://portwell.com/products/detail.php?CUSTCHAR1=CAF-0100) (Too wide for a half-rack, IB-ECC)


## Purchase

I must have looked at hundreds or thousands of mini PCs on obscure industrial and electronics distributor websites.

The [Nexcom DNA 141](https://www.nexcomusa.com/Products/network-and-communication-solutions/cyber-security-solutions/desktop-x86-based-appliance/desktop-x86-based-appliance-dna-141) would have made the perfect router (chef's kiss), but I was unable to find a reseller/distributor. I reached out to Nexcom, but they informed me that they don't sell to individuals. When I asked about a reseller/distributor in the US, they stopped replying ðŸ¤·.

I almost ended up purchasing a Lanner NCA-1510. Funny enough, the Lanner NCA-1510A is the OEM of the Netgate SG-5100, according to a few posts ([here](https://forum.netgate.com/post/1040249), [here](https://chaos.social/@JeGr/112512006883278146), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PFSENSE/comments/1b8lg3z/comment/kttopfw/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PFSENSE/comments/93kl91/comment/e4admnm/)).

I ended up going with the Deciso DEC740, as it was the only one that had ECC memory in such a small footprint and it was easy to purchase as a non-business.

{{< video_figure src="20250202_001.mp4" width="100%" attr="Video from OPNsense" attrlink="https://shop.opnsense.com/product/dec740-opnsense-desktop-security-appliance/" >}}

To me, it's the spritual successor to the APU2 (it's almost the same size, same layout, but updated with modern hardware for modern applications). There is some really good information [here](https://wiki.junicast.de/en/junicast/review/opnsense_dec740) and [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20240407173603/https://www.deciso.com/netboard-a10-gen3/) about the DEC740 and its specifications (the second link is an Archive.org link because the URL is currently returning a 404). The box included the DEC740, the US power adapter, and a mini-USB cable (for the serial port).

{{< img src="20250215_002.jpg" alt="dec740" >}}

Based on [this comparison](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/5050vs4304/AMD-GX-412TC-SOC-vs-AMD-Ryzen-Embedded-V1500B), the CPU in the new device should run rings around my own APU2. Plus, this device has 2x 10Gbps SFP+ ports.

{{< img src="20250203_002.png" alt="cpu comparison" >}}

## ECC RAM upgrade

I also picked up a stick of 32GB DDR4 ECC UDIMM VLP (specifically model number MTA18ADF4G72AZ-2G6 from [Memory.net](https://memory.net/product/mta18adf4g72az-2g6-micron-1x-32gb-ddr4-2666-ecc-udimm-pc4-21300v-e-dual-rank-x8-module/)) for $124. I would assume any ECC memory would work here, but it has to be UDIMM and it has to be Very Low Profile (VLP). I've never used VLP RAM before, so here is a picture comparing two sticks of regular DDR4 DIMMs (top) to a single DDR4 VLP DIMM (bottom).

{{< img src="20250215_001.jpg" alt="vlp ram" >}}

There are four Torx screws on the bottom of the unit (one with an [unenforcable-in-the-USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnuson%E2%80%93Moss_Warranty_Act) "void if removed" sticker). Then, the black heatsink part of the unit slides away from the front face.

{{< img src="20250215_003.jpg" alt="dec740 opened" >}}

There are four more Torx screws holding the PCB onto the black heatsink. The SSD is a Transcend 128GB NVMe PCIe Gen3 x4 (TS128GMTE110S). I didn't bother to replace this, since I ship my logs to [Graylog](https://graylog.org/), so they're not stored on the SSD anyway.

{{< img src="20250215_004.jpg" alt="dec740 opened" >}}

I upgraded the RAM, cleaned the old paste off with isopropyl, then re-pasted the CPU using Noctua NT-H2.

{{< img src="20250215_005.jpg" alt="dec740 opened" >}}

This is the view from the other side of the RAM stick (you can see the button-cell battery here for the BIOS).

{{< img src="20250215_006.jpg" alt="dec740 opened" >}}

Here is the die shot of the CPU.

# Decisions

## Did I pay over $800 for a router?!

Yes. My router is arguably the most important device on my network. It protects my network from the big, bad internet. I don't mind paying for a product that can do that job silently, reliably, 24/7, now and 10 years into the future. If I amortize the $800 over 10 years, that's only $80 per year (I spend more money per year on Chipotle).

Side note - This is a week of data from my Graylog instance. This is what my router is protecting me from.

## Why pfSense?

I know that Netgate (the company that owns pfSense) has had some controversies:

- 2016: When OPNsense sense was forked from pfSense, Netgate purchased the domain OPNsense.com and [setup a parody site](https://web.archive.org/web/20160314132836/http://www.opnsense.com/) to discredit OPNsense. OPNsense had to [appeal](https://opnsense.org/opnsense-com/) to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) to get control of the domain.
- 2017: Netgate announced ([here](https://www.netgate.com/blog/pfsense-2-5-and-aes-ni) and [here](https://www.netgate.com/blog/more-on-aes-ni)) that pfSense 2.5 would require [AES-NI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set), then [walked that back in 2019](https://www.netgate.com/blog/pfsense-2-5-0-development-snapshots-now-available)
- 2017: Netgate implemented a scary-looking popup [disclaimer](https://www.netgate.com/blog/its-still-free-to-use) in order to use pfSense
- 2019: Netgate hired a developer to implement WireGuard for pfSense and then upstream the code to FreeBSD (side note - apparently the developer was [slighty crazy](https://www.theregister.com/2008/04/24/kip_macy_arrest/)). This was finished in 2020. In 2021, it was clear the code was not production-ready. Netgate gets defensive and is [called out by the WireGuard developer himself](https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/dev-commits-src-all/2021-March/004413.html). Netgate then has to do [damage control](https://www.netgate.com/blog/painful-lessons-learned-in-security-and-community).
- 2021: Netgate [announced](https://www.netgate.com/blog/announcing-pfsense-plus) a closed-source version of pfSense called pfSense Plus (which gets more love and attention from Netgate than the open-source version)
- 2023: Netgate pushed homelabbers from a free Community Edition license to pfSense Plus (called Home+Lab edition), then changed their mind and [started charging for the Home+Lab license](https://www.netgate.com/blog/addressing-changes-to-pfsense-plus-homelab)
- 2024: Netgate locked the installer for pfSense CE (the free version) [behind a login page](https://www.reddit.com/r/PFSENSE/comments/1chzp1n/comment/l29c7gw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

So, with all that said: why am I using pfSense?

To be honest, I just don't care about any of the drama above because it doesn't affect me. I don't pay for pfSense (and wouldn't with the way Netgate acts), so I don't feel like I'm "supporting" their bad behavior. I'll continue to use the free version of pfSense until they make it paid, or closed-source, then I'll switch to OPNsense. But right now, I don't feel like learning OPNsense and re-building my firewall from scratch (I just want to restore a backup and get on with life).

# Pre-installation

## Console settings

The serial adapter shows up as `Exar Corp. XR21B1411 UART` in Linux, and I verifed it connected to `/dev/ttyUSB0` to by using `sudo dmesg | grep tty`. I tried to use `screen` to connect to it, but after a while, the characters on the screen would get misaligned and impossible to read.

```
screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
```

I ended up using [tio](https://github.com/tio/tio), which worked great.

```
tio /dev/ttyUSB0
```

This was the BIOS that shipped with the DEC740. According to [this page](https://docs.opnsense.org/hardware/bios.html), it's up-to-date.

```
BIOS Version : 05.38.09.0023-A10.30
BIOS Build Date : 05/01/2024
Processor Type : AMD Ryzen Embedded V1500B
System Memory Speed : 2400 MHz
```

At boot, you can press `ESC` once to enter the BIOS "Front Page".

### ECC error injection

At the Front Page, go to `Setup Utility`, then `AMD CBS`, then `UMC Common Options`, then `DDR4 Common Options`, then `Common RAS`. Then, set the `Disable Memory Error Injection` to `False` (since we want to test ECC memory errors).

### Memory overclock

:warning: WARNING :warning: The RAM I bought was 2666MHz, but was showing up as 2400MHz. I tried to overclock it to 2666MHz (below), but kept getting errors when running MemTest86 Pro. You may want to skip this part.

At the Front Page, go to `Setup Utility`, then `AMD CBS`, then `UMC Common Options`, then `DDR4 Common Options`, then `DRAM Timing Configuration`, then accept the warning, then set `Memory Overclock Settings` to `Enabled`.

Then, set the `Memory Clock Speed` to `1333MHz` (since it's DDR memory, this works out to 2666MHz).

## Memory test

I always test my memory, but since this was ECC memory, I needed a program to test it. Apparently, MemTest86+ (the open-source tool), [doesn't support testing ECC](https://github.com/memtest86plus/memtest86plus/discussions/248) yet. MemTest86 Pro (the closed-source tool) does [support ECC injection](https://www.memtest86.com/ecc.htm), so that's what I went with.

For reference, here is the [MemTest86 Pro configuration](https://www.memtest86.com/tech_configuring-memtest.html) called `mt86.cfg` that I was using.

```
ECCPOLL=1
ECCINJECT=1
LANG=en-US
AUTOMODE=1
AUTOREPORT=1
AUTOREPORTFMT=HTML
EXITMODE=0
CONSOLEONLY=1
```

At the Front Page, go to `Boot Manager`. I was able to boot from a USB flash drive containing MemTest86 Pro and it started the test right away.

```

You will see errors in MemTest86 Pro, since it's injecting ECC errors to test the ECC. I left MemTest86 Pro to run for about 12 hours and came back to this (report below).

## Installing pfSense

Download the memstick installer for pfSense and write it to a USB flash drive. You can find links and instructions [here](https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/install/download-installer-image.html), but the installer there is behind a login page (as I mentioned above), so you can get the `pfSense-CE-memstick-serial-2.7.2-RELEASE-amd64.img.gz` file directly from [here](https://atxfiles.netgate.com/mirror/downloads/).

This is totally optional, but I chose to backup my current pfSense `config.xml` file and place a copy onto the installation USB flash drive as per [these instructions](https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/backup/restore-during-install.html#restore-configuration-from-media-during-install). That way, immediately after install, pfSense would restore my configuration file (saving me a step later).

At the Front Page, go to `Boot Manager`. I was able to boot from a USB flash drive containing the pfSense installer.

When you first see this menu, and it's counting down from 3...2...1, you need to press `ESC` once. The reason is that the DEC740 uses different serial settings that are not in the pfSense 2.7.2 installer. See [this post](https://forum.netgate.com/topic/180986/dec740-desktop-security-appliance-cannot-proceed-with-installation-of-pfsense/9?_=1739734218359) for details and [this PR](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D34329) for eventually getting this added to FreeBSD upstream.

```

Then, you'll see the `OK` prompt.

```
Type '?' for a list of commands, 'help' for more detailed help.
OK
```

There, you can paste in these two commands.

```
set hw.uart.console="mm:0xfedc9000,rs:2"
boot
```

Go through the [install process](https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/install/install-pfsense.html) via the serial console. Once it's done, reboot again, press `ESC` once, then enter the two commands above. Here, you'll need to setup your interfaces and VLANs. Now at the menu below, select `8` to enter the shell.

```
 0) Logout (SSH only)                  9) pfTop
 1) Assign Interfaces                 10) Filter Logs
 2) Set interface(s) IP address       11) Restart webConfigurator
 3) Reset webConfigurator password    12) PHP shell + pfSense tools
 4) Reset to factory defaults         13) Update from console
 5) Reboot system                     14) Disable Secure Shell (sshd)
 6) Halt system                       15) Restore recent configuration
 7) Ping host                         16) Restart PHP-FPM
 8) Shell

Enter an option:
```

Now, use `vi` to edit the `/boot/loader.conf.local` file to add these two lines.

```
console="efi"
hw.uart.console="mm:0xfedc9000,rs:2"
```

Reboot using the `reboot` command, and you should see pfSense boot normally, without having to edit your console settings again.

From here, you can connect an ethernet cable to your LAN interface and setup pfSense. If you're curious, here is the info about the five on-board NICs. The three RJ-45 ports are [Intel I226-V](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=igc&manpath=FreeBSD+14.0-RELEASE) and the two SFP+ ports are from the [AMD CPU](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=axp&manpath=FreeBSD+14.0-RELEASE).

The installation process couldn't have been easier. pfSense has excellent documentation, and Tom Lawrence has a [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oi02LayIIM) talking about the process of restoring from a backup (both to the same hardware, and different hardware).
