# Introduction

This past weekend, I physically removed the SSD that held my Windows 10 installation from my desktop PC. I realized that for the first time in my entire life, I didn't have Windows installed on a piece of bare metal hardware. This article isn't just about virtualization though, it's about ditching Windows altogether.

## My Windows journey

When I was a kid, I don't remember what year we first got a computer, but I do remember that it was a loud, beige box from Compaq running [Windows 98](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_98). I remember using dial-up internet, playing [Total Annihilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Annihilation), and typing simple pages for school on [Office 97](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_97).

We steadily upgraded that computer, and eventually replaced it. I did my senior project about a friend's brother who owned a computer building/repair business, which culminated in me building a new computer for us in 2006 (God, I'm old ðŸ˜…).

My first big-boy job was a paid internship in 2011 working in the helpdesk at a clothing company. It was a Windows shop, so it was all about fixing laptops, joining computers to the domain, answering phones, and doing [Windows XP Service Pack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP#Service_packs) upgrades en masse (yes, we were running an OS from 2006 in 2011).

While in college, my parents bought me my first laptop, a Toshiba Qosmio F45-AV410 (it was some really cool physical media controls).

I then also purchased an ASUS Eee PC 1005HA-PU1X-BK. This was a 10" PC that was ridiculously small, had terrible battery life, and generally ran like crap. It shipped with Windows XP, which I upgraded to Windows Vista and later to Windows 7.

So at this point, I had one laptop for actual important school work, and one to satify my technical curiosity.

## My Linux journey

My homelab journey took off then I [purchased a Raspberry Pi 3 so that I could run the UniFi controller software](/2016/11/ubiquiti-unifi-controller-setup-on-raspberry-pi-3/). I then needed a wiki to document my setup, so I installed DokuWiki,
