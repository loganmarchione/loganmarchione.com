# Introduction

I know I'm about five years too late too the party, but I finally setup [Proxmox Backup Server (PBS)](https://www.proxmox.com/en/products/proxmox-backup-server/overview).

Right now, I have 10 servers inside my Proxmox Virtual Environment (VE) setup, made up of a mix of virtual machines (VMs) and LXC containers (LXCs). I'm using the [built-in Proxmox VE backup system](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Backup_and_Restore) to backup my VMs/LXCs to my NAS. This results in about 250GB of backups, which happen once a week. I keep 12 weeks of backups, so that's 3TB of backups on my NAS. Even if nothing changes week-to-week on a single server, the entire machine is getting backed up every week, taking up the full amount of space.

Proxmox Backup Server is a separate backup solution that has a [ton of features](https://www.proxmox.com/en/products/proxmox-backup-server/features):

- designed specifically to work with Proxmox VE
- open-source
- written in Rust (so it's memory safe)
- free (as in freedom and beer), though they do have a [paid support plan](https://www.proxmox.com/en/products/proxmox-backup-server/pricing) (but I'm unsure why it's so much more expensive than [the Proxmox VE support plan](https://www.proxmox.com/en/products/proxmox-virtual-environment/pricing))
- incremental backups
- deduplication
- compression
- encryption
- checksums
- granular restores (e.g., single files from a machine)

The big selling points here are incremental backups and deduplication. Incremental, meaning that there is a single, large, initial backup for each machine, and then each subsequent backup only backs up the changed files. Deduplication, meaning that files that are the same across backups are only stored once. Both of these combined can save you a *ton* of space on backups. I've read online that the deduplication ratio can be as high as 50:1 or 100:1 (as in, `ratio = original_data_size / stored_data_size`).

# Hardware

I was looking for the following things in a PBS box:

- small (needs to fit in my [mini-rack](/2021/01/homelab-10-mini-rack/))
- x86 (to run PBS)
- DDR4/DDR5 memory (ECC if possible)
- fanless (one less thing to dust)
- Intel NICs
- M.2 storage

It's easy to find all of that in cheap Chinese mini PCs on Amazon, except ECC support. [Error correcting code (ECC) memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECC_memory) is special memory that has an extra chip on the RAM stick that is used for parity bits to detect and correct bit-flips in memory. It's generally used on servers, and hardly ever used on consumer PCs (especially mini PCs). I was also trying to find something that was from a relatively well-known manufacturer that wouldn't burn my house down. The Chinese mini PCs worry me, because they're all no-name brands that disappear from Amazon after a few months (or provide no support if they don't disappear).

## Comparison

I must have looked at hundreds or thousands of mini PCs on obscure industrial and electronics distributor websites. Below are the devices that I found in my searching.
