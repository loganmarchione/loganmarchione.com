# Introduction

I've been using my home-made [mini-rack](/2021/01/homelab-10-mini-rack/) for a few years now. My main complaint is that the shelves *themselves* are the horizontal structure on the front face of the unit. If I start removing them, the unit flexes.

{{< img src="20220915_001.jpeg" alt="mini-rack" >}}

However, mini-racks have come a long way since then. DeskPi has their [wildly popular RackMate line](https://deskpi.com/collections/deskpi-rack-mate) of mini-racks, and Jeff Geerling started [Project MINI RACK](https://mini-rack.jeffgeerling.com/). All of this left my home-made mini-rack feeling a little old.

I only have space for 4U, so a [DeskPi Rack Mate T0](https://deskpi.com/products/deskpi-rackmate-t1-rackmount-10-inch-4u-server-cabinet-for-network-servers-audio-and-video-equipment) would have been perfect. However, there is a problem. My mini-rack sits on a very short shelf, and the RackMate T0 is too tall by about an inch, due to the large aluminum "forehead" at the top of the rack.

{{< figure src="20250814_001.jpg" width="74%" loading="lazy" alt="deskpi rackmate t0" attr="DeskPi RackMate T0 from DeskPi" attrlink="https://deskpi.com/products/deskpi-rackmate-t1-rackmount-10-inch-4u-server-cabinet-for-network-servers-audio-and-video-equipment">}}

So naturally, I over-engineered (and over-paid for), my own rack ðŸ¤·.

# Standards

As I [discussed in the past](/2022/09/homelab-10-mini-rack-shelves/#10-inch-racks), there is no standard for mini-racks. They're generally half the size of a 19-inch rack, which would put them at 9.5-inches, but people actually refer to them as 10-inch racks, or half-racks.

Also, in my last post, I said:

> I know that the [imperial system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_units) of units is inferior to the metric system, but these are 10-inch racks, not 254mm racks :man_shrugging:

Well, I'm eating my words now. Because of the small dimensions I'm working with, I decided to do all of my measurements in millimeters. With that said, the holes on the [shelves](https://deskpi.com/products/deskpi) I'm using are 235mm center-to-center, so that was my basis for the mini-rack.

# Design

I've been seeing a ton of racks made of extruded aluminum. I guess I'm late on this, but extruded aluminum is like Lego for adults. It's really lightweight, easy to work with, has exact dimensions, and has slots on all four sides to connect pieces, accessories, etc... The different sizes are named for their dimensions (below are examples of 20x20mm and 20x40mm, respectively).

{{< figure src="20250814_002.jpg" width="25%" loading="lazy" alt="20x20 aluminum" attr="20x20 aluminum from 8020.net" attrlink="https://8020.net/20-2020.html">}}

{{< figure src="20250814_003.jpg" width="25%" loading="lazy" alt="20x40 aluminum" attr="20x40 aluminum from 8020.net" attrlink="https://8020.net/20-2040.html">}}

From what I can tell, [8020.net](https://8020.net) and [Misumi](https://us.misumi-ec.com/) are the biggest and/or most popular distributors, though you can get this stuff cheap on Amazon and AliExpress. What's nice is that since aluminum is a relatively soft metal, you can cut it with a bandsaw or chop saw. I don't have one of those, but both 8020.net and Misumi will cut it for you (for a small fee).

I decided on 20x20 aluminum rails. They are relatively small, but I have seen rails as small as 15x15 or 10x10. I decided to mount the shelves directly to the aluminum rails (in-place of [traditional rack rails](https://www.penn-elcom.com/us/4u-rack-rail-with-full-holes-0-08in-thick-r0863-2mm-04)).

Both 8020.net and Misumi have 3D building tools (and they both let you download 3D models of their products for use in other tools). 8020.net has the browser-based [IdeaBuilder](https://ideabuilder.io/) that lets you model *almost* anything in their catalog, while Misumi has [Frames](https://us.misumi-ec.com/service/promotion/frames/) (I wasn't able to use this because it is Windows-only). In IdeaBuilder, you can save your model to the cloud or a local file, and then upload the Bill of Materials (BoM) to your cart to get a list of all the parts you need. Below is what I built in just a few minutes in IdeaBuilder. If you're interested, [here is the JSON file](/2025/09/homelab-10-mini-rack-v2/v2.json) that you can upload to IdeaBuilder to get started. 

{{< img src="20250814_004.png" alt="IdeaBuilder" >}}

I also built the same rack (without hardware) using Misumi's rails in [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) (this is a 3D model, so you should be able to rotate/zoom). [Here is the STL file](/2025/09/homelab-10-mini-rack-v2/tinkercad-misumi.stl) if you want to download it.

{{< threejs-stl version="0.179.1" id="mini-rackv2" width="600" height="600" color="#a7adb1ff" background="#e9e9e9ff" rotateX="-90" rotateY="0" rotateZ="0" center="true" stl="tinkercad-misumi.stl" >}}

## Parts

Below are the parts that are part of my IdeaBuilder 3D design (i.e., this is what you get if you upload the JSON file). However, I only ended up purchasing the 20x20 aluminum, since the hardware was too expensive. Also, the corners work everywhere except where the front shelves fit, so I scrapped them as well.

I also added some other parts that I wasn't able to model in IdeaBuilder. These are going to be used to secure the shelves (in-place of [traditional rack rails](https://www.penn-elcom.com/us/4u-rack-rail-with-full-holes-0-08in-thick-r0863-2mm-04)).

Be warned, however, that not all 20x20 aluminum is the same. For example, [these](https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-Interior-Connector-Aluminum-Extrusion/dp/B07VP59DY5) inside corner brackets didn't fit into the 20x20 aluminum from 8020.net, since the "slot" is ~5.26mm, not a true 6mm.

I also added these 1U parts.

In total, that's $258.69 in new parts for the rack and hardware.

# Conclusion

What would I do differently next time? I would definitely not have spent so much money. I would use IdeaBuilder to create the 3D model, but purchase the parts from a different vendor. For example, each cut from 8020.net is $2.87, so I'm already spending $34.44 on cuts because I don't have a saw. For the same price, I would have been able to purchase a [mini cut-off saw](https://www.harborfreight.com/09-amp-2-in-mini-cut-off-saw-70478.html), purchase 20x20 aluminum in bulk from Amazon, then cut it myself. Also, I don't know why the corner brackets from 8020.net were so expensive. I would have definitely shopped around more for [cheaper alternatives](https://us.misumi-ec.com/vona2/detail/110300438930/?ProductCode=HBLSS5).
