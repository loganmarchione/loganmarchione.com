Hey Logan,

Thank you for your clear guides!  
I&#8217;m trying to configure a pptp vpn on an Edgerouter X with dyndns. Basically what I&#8217;m trying to do is connect to a vpn using my dyndns hostname. Unfortunately I have not successfully done this. If I try to connect directly from the LAN to the router&#8217;s IP, the connection is successfully, but if I try from the outside, the connection refuses.

Any orientation or guide you can give me to this?

Thank you, in advance.

Kind regards.

Kevin

I would not recommend PPTP, it&#8217;s known to be easy to break.

Did you open the correct ports for PPTP to access your router?
