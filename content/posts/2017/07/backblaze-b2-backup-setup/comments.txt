thank you for the tutorial, i am trying to replicate this on freebsd

### Comment by Mike on 2017-08-20 00:04:25 -0400
curious what cron configuration do you use for your backup, thanks?

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2017-08-20 01:23:09 -0400
Good luck, I would like to know how it goes!

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2017-08-20 01:24:04 -0400
None yet, I&#8217;m still looking to get a NAS to run this on. However, I plan on doing once a week when I do get it setup.

### Comment by Mike on 2017-08-20 03:49:05 -0400
reviewing the script, I generated PGP keys unsing gnupg. I located the keys and know the passphrase i used when making them. I am unsure which field i input the public key, do I input the passphrase I used to create the keys? Not exactly sure about the fields below. I know you mentioned you created 2 sets of keys. I only created 1 set (pub/priv). Thanks for the help

ENC\_KEY, SGN\_KEY, PASSPHRASE, SIGN_PASSPHRASE

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2017-08-20 10:10:21 -0400
Sorry for the confusion.

ENC\_KEY=&#8221;EEEEEEEE&#8221; and SGN\_KEY=&#8221;FFFFFFFF&#8221; are the last eight digits of the public fingerprint of your keys (in your case, it&#8217;s the same key).

export PASSPHRASE=&#8221;GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG&#8221; and export SIGN_PASSPHRASE=&#8221;HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH&#8221; are the passwords to your keys (in your case, it&#8217;s the same password because it&#8217;s the same key)

### Comment by Mike on 2017-08-20 12:59:54 -0400
Thanks for the clarification.

Where does the public key need to be located for this script to work? or does it pull the key from MIT&#8217;s servers? thank you!

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2017-08-21 10:36:56 -0400
Keep the public key in your ~/.gnupg directory (the default location). Duplicity knows to look in that directory (assuming you&#8217;re running the script as you).

### Comment by Skip Chang on 2017-08-30 00:47:14 -0400
Hi,  
When I followed your script and execute, I get the following error:  
UnsupportedBackendScheme: scheme not supported in url: b2://<>:<>@B2 Bucket/B2 Dir.  
(I&#8217;ve removed my info from the error).  
Thanks.

### Comment by Domenic on 2017-08-30 09:26:56 -0400
Specifically, what GPG files would you need to have store elsewhere in order to restore files from an encrypted B2? Do you have a sample restore script?

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2017-08-30 12:43:28 -0400
You would need to keep your private key (since your files are encrypted with your public key), but I would backup all your public and private keys from ~/.gnupg (and store the backup somewhere secure).  
`cd<br />
tar -czf gpg.tgz ./.gnupg`

You can use the command below as an example, but I haven&#8217;t tested it.  
`duplicity --sign-key $SGN_KEY --encrypt-key $ENC_KEY restore --file-to-restore ${B2_DIR} b2://${B2_ACCOUNT}:${B2_KEY}@{B2_BUCKET} <restore_location></restore_location>`

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2017-08-30 13:55:40 -0400
Did you remove the brackets, or is that part of your command?

Are you running this on Linux? If so, what distro? Also, I see there is a <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1632475" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bug open</a> for this too.

### Comment by Michael on 2017-09-01 04:22:20 -0400
i generated the keys on my desktop then copied the entire dir into my remote comp running the script (where the data is located) when i execute the script i keep running into the below (seems that it doesnt think i have keys already there, which they are).

### Comment by Michael on 2017-09-01 04:24:02 -0400
keys are located in the /.gnupg dir

also this is on FreeBSD but shouldn&#8217;t matter.  
I wasn&#8217;t able to generate enough entropy which is why I needed to create then move the /.gnupg dir over to the server.

I had an idea that maybe the permissions were incorrect since I had copied the files from my desktop to the server (3 files were created at 01:15 as a result of the script not detecting the keys already in there). What do you think? thanks!

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2017-09-02 10:16:59 -0400
Can you try going an export/import with the GPG command line, instead of copying the directory?  
<a href="http://www.koozie.org/blog/2014/07/migrating-gnupg-keys-from-one-computer-to-another/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.koozie.org/blog/2014/07/migrating-gnupg-keys-from-one-computer-to-another/</a>  
<a href="https://www.phildev.net/pgp/gpg_moving_keys.html" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.phildev.net/pgp/gpg_moving_keys.html</a>

When you did the copy, did you preserve permissions?

Also, you said you created them on your desktop. Is your desktop Linux or FreeBSD?

### Comment by Stephen on 2017-09-03 16:35:08 -0400
I spent an hour or so bashing my head on a wall because of this error:

gpg: no default secret key: bad passphrase  
gpg: [stdin]: sign+encrypt failed: bad passphrase

Turns out my passphrase had a few characters that bash didn&#8217;t like and using single quotes, instead of double, for the passphrase variables in the backup script solved my issue.

Thanks for the guide

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2017-09-04 22:17:52 -0400
Ah, good catch! Thanks for sharing!

### Comment by Jeff G on 2017-09-06 18:54:09 -0400
I&#8217;ve found today that adding these two parameters increases the likelihood of a successful backup to B2:

&#8211;timeout 90 \  
&#8211;tempdir /big-fast-file-system/temp \  
&#8230;.

The default temp file system on my machine was too small and my backups would repeatedly fail with error:

Attempt 1 failed. SSLError: (&#8216;The read operation timed out&#8217;,)

After changing the temp directory location, I would still get the above error, but less often. That&#8217;s when I tried adding the timeout parameter as 90 seconds. Without the parameter, it takes a default of 30 seconds.

With these two additions, my 4+GB backups started completing successfully.

Thanks for the leg-up!

### Comment by Jeff G on 2017-09-06 19:04:34 -0400
Another suggestion for the script is to not delete old backups &#8212; even those older than 90 days &#8212; until you know that you have a new, good backup. 

It would be a shame if your last good backup was heartlessly deleted before getting a new, good backup.

My $0.02..

### Comment by Matt on 2017-09-06 19:46:50 -0400
Thanks for the script. Had to do some homework on gpg to get that part working, but good to go now.

### Comment by Matt on 2017-09-06 19:47:26 -0400
Should say I found your blog from the B2 website.

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2017-09-07 08:28:15 -0400
Yes, I saw their referrer links on my analytics site, it was a nice surprise!

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2017-09-07 08:28:27 -0400
Glad it&#8217;s working!

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2017-09-07 09:15:38 -0400
Thanks for the info! I&#8217;m planning a large backup of 100GB, so if it fails I&#8217;ll edit my script to include your recommendations.

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2017-09-07 09:16:40 -0400
I agree with you there. I&#8217;m only doing the delete before the backup to free up space, but you could easily swap those two portions around.

### Comment by Matt on 2017-09-07 12:23:54 -0400
How did it go?

### Comment by Simon on 2017-09-18 11:55:10 -0400
Since I&#8217;ve been struggling with it for a while I thought I’d share my experiences trying to restore a directory from B2 that I made with your script. I’ve backed up to a bucket with 3 directories a,b and c using a small quantity of test data. So on the backend I have:

Bucket-name  
/a  
/b  
/c

The command that successfully restored directory b is this:

duplicity \  
restore \  
&#8211;sign-key $FULL_KEY \  
&#8211;encrypt-key $FULL_KEY \  
&#8211;file-to-restore ${B2_RESTORE} \  
b2://${B2\_ACCOUNT}:${B2\_KEY}@${B2\_BUCKET}/${B2\_DIR} ${LOCAL_DIR} 

Where:

B2_DIR=”/b”  
B2_RESTORE=”/”  
LOCAL_DIR=”/backup/restore”

This isn’t how the man page suggests it should work but if I didn’t include the bucket directory I found that I’d get an error “No backup chains with active signatures found”.

### Comment by Simon on 2017-09-18 11:57:08 -0400
Sorry &#8211; I should have also mentioned that I&#8217;m on Debian 9 running Duplicity 0.7.14 (installed manually from the website tar.gz)

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2017-09-18 12:04:49 -0400
Much appreciated, thanks for sharing!

### Comment by Skip Chang on 2017-10-05 09:18:38 -0400
Logan,  
Thanks for the reply. When I couldn&#8217;t get this to work on my CentOS 6.9 server, I moved on to rclone.  
I saw the open bug and it&#8217;s the same issue I&#8217;m running into with my CentOS setup. I&#8217;ve been holding off on upgrading to CentOS7.x. I guess I need to start planning the migration.  
Thanks.

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2017-10-05 09:21:52 -0400
Glad it wasn&#8217;t a misconfiguration. Hopefully your upgrade goes smoothly!

### Comment by Dan Survivale on 2017-10-30 15:56:43 -0400
Great article, but two questions: do I need a stage dir?

In other words, if I have 1TB to backup, is duplicity going to create a temporary compressed copy of that 1TB in /tmp (or wherever) before it uploads?

Also, what if I&#8217;m restoring 1 file from that 1TB full? Can it extract one file out of the .tar.gz on b2?

### Comment by Shon Vella on 2017-11-25 11:10:32 -0500
FYI &#8211; there is no need to for all of the unset&#8217;s at the end of the script since variables are local to the script (unlike .bat/.cmd scripts from DOS/Windows.)

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2017-11-27 09:21:57 -0500
Didn&#8217;t know that, thanks for the tip!

### Comment by Jeff on 2017-12-16 08:32:28 -0500
Hey Logan,

Just wanted to say great blog! I stumbled upon it googling something like &#8220;Archer C7 OpenWRT OpenVPN server&#8221; and am finding all your articles awesome. I&#8217;m going through and bookmarking weekend projects.

I&#8217;ve been kicking myself for quite some time to setup some offsite backups, and this seems like a fun project for this weekend. I&#8217;ll report back how things go.

Spoilers &#8211; I&#8217;ll probably just sign up for Backblaze B2 and sync from my Synology NAS. I&#8217;m impressed that they&#8217;ve made it so simple.

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2017-12-17 17:28:33 -0500
Thanks, always happy to help out!

Let me know how it goes! I&#8217;m looking at a Synology myself. Which model do you have? Would you recommend it?

### Comment by Jeff on 2017-12-18 19:08:03 -0500
Hi Logan &#8211; I have a Synology DS213J.

I&#8217;m happy with it, and I&#8217;m glad it lasted me from the start of 2013, all the way out to now. Synology have been great at releasing regular updates. It&#8217;s a great NAS for general users who want access to their files, and access to community packages (torrent clients, music servers, couchpotato/sonarr, nzbget/sabnzbd). 

If you purchase a more recent model, you can even run Docker containers.

I&#8217;d say Synology are the best out of those prebuilt NAS devices. If my main purpose for buying it was to tinker, I may have preferred my own FreeNAS/unRAID box. 

I also like that support for the different backup targets is built right into the device. I did a proof of concept, syncing a few GB of data to Backblaze. The encryption / consistency checks added less overhead than I expected.

I&#8217;m going to do a bit more research before uploading everything though.

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2017-12-19 18:49:57 -0500
Very cool! I&#8217;m looking at the DS216J.

Let me know how Backblaze works out for you on a large upload.

### Comment by Gergo on 2018-01-18 06:53:22 -0500
hi Logan,  
first of all thank you for your fantastic guide! I used it, working perfectly. 

I uploaded ~15GB so far and I used ~5000 transactions. (total amount will be ~400GB)  
I just realized that Backblaze B2 is charging for Class B and Class C transactions.  
&#8211; storage cost is $0.005/GB  
&#8211; Class B transaction $0.004/10000 calls (first 2500 is free every day)  
&#8211; Class C transaction $0.004/1000 calls (first 2500 is free every day)

Technical question:  
is there any difference in number of transactions for the following two methods?  
1, your script  
2, duplicity to local drive first then simply upload to cloud

(reason for asking is that I see the following transaction types/numbers when using your method:  
&#8211; delete file / 1063 <- why is it deleting?  
&#8211; get upload URL / 1065  
&#8211; list file names / 2126  
&#8211; upload file / 1058 )

the cost of transactions are quite low, so it is a theoretical question only 🙂  
thank you  
Gergo

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2018-01-18 11:25:36 -0500
I&#8217;ll admit, I haven&#8217;t looked much the transaction differences yet. As you mentioned, the costs are so low, it&#8217;s a negligible amount, especially once you get past the first large upload.

As for your question, I don&#8217;t think there would be a difference, unless you uploaded your files as one large compressed file.

Also, to save some transactions, you could:  
-remove the deletion of old files, but your required B2 storage would never stop growing  
-remove the collection status, since you&#8217;re basically just listing files out

### Comment by Gergo on 2018-01-19 04:21:13 -0500
thank you for your quick response !

### Comment by Tim on 2018-04-09 21:06:50 -0400
Logan, thanks for the incredibly helpful guide. With your help, I was able to get some backups moving off to B2. However, I ran into a hiccup, and I&#8217;m wondering if you or others have had this issue:

I&#8217;m doing a backup of about 800 GB, but 24 hours in (give or take a little bit), the backup failed after only pushing 60 GB. The initial command was set to run a full backup, and your script was set up in a &#8220;nohup &#8230; &&#8221; command in terminal. Is there a way to resume a failed backup?

For what it&#8217;s worth, the backup failed on this error:  
Writing duplicity-full.20180407T234349Z.vol2091.difftar.gpg  
Giving up after 5 attempts. HTTPError: HTTP Error 401: Unauthorized

Thanks for any help or insight you can offer!

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2018-04-10 13:10:54 -0400
I haven&#8217;t run that large of a backup yet, but another <a href="https://loganmarchione.com/2017/07/backblaze-b2-backup-setup/#comment-148894" rel="noopener">commenter</a> added a few flags to assist with large backups. Might be worth checking out.

### Comment by Tim on 2018-04-10 20:14:32 -0400
Thanks, and I did see that. I did a little more digging, and did discover that Duplicity will fail after 24 hours of being connected to B2. This was solved in version 7.08 (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1588503" rel="nofollow ugc">https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1588503</a>), but the update seems to not have been pushed out to the repositories for Ubuntu 16.04. I will run a manual install and test it out.

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2018-04-11 21:18:21 -0400
Nice find! Let me know if it works. It seems they also have a <a href="https://launchpad.net/~duplicity-team/+archive/ubuntu/ppa" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PPA</a> if you want to try that.

### Comment by Tim on 2018-04-19 09:47:16 -0400
That did work! And thanks for the recommendation with the PPA. 

For anyone interested, I ran the same backup script again, and Duplicity was able to check what was already backed up. It just picked up where it left off, and it&#8217;s been uploading like a charm.

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2018-04-19 11:09:25 -0400
Glad it&#8217;s working!

### Comment by John on 2018-06-12 17:45:49 -0400
Hey,

Ive run into a couple of issues. If I run as root I get a GPG key not found error. Where would I call this in the script for root?

When I run it as my normal user I get

### Comment by john on 2018-06-12 17:46:27 -0400
p.s works just fine when run in terminal

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2018-06-19 09:57:20 -0400
Are you trying to create the GPG key as yourself, or root? Whichever user account creates the key is the user account that needs to run duplicity.

### Comment by Tristan on 2018-10-21 09:12:36 -0400
I followed this tutorial and completed a full backup of my machine. It took ~54 hours and was ~500GB. The output showed 0 errors. However when I try any commands such as collection-status or list-current-files, duplicity finds no backups at all. When I browse the bucket I can see that it contains ~500GB of files. There are a lot of files of 209.8MB, with different timestamps and volume numbers, like &#8216;pc/duplicity-full.20181016T214816Z.vol1.difftar.gpg &#8216; or &#8216;pc/duplicity-full.20181018T114323Z.vol1221.difftar.gpg&#8217;. The &#8216;pc/&#8217; is because I used the filepath [bucket name]/pc, I thought this would create a directory called &#8216;pc&#8217; in the bucket and place the files there. When looking at the info for the bucket, under &#8216;Unfinished Large Files&#8217; there is one file, &#8216;pc%2Fduplicity-full.20181016T214816Z.vol541.difftar.gpg&#8217;. Could this be the reason Duplicity can&#8217;t find any backups? i wonder if I tried to back up to much at once and the uploads being on different days is an issue. I can&#8217;t find much information elsewhere online, any help would be much appreciated.

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2018-10-22 08:22:22 -0400
Tristan, I switched from Duplicity to rclone, so I can&#8217;t be much help here unfortunately. Yes, it&#8217;s possible that Duplicity can&#8217;t create a list of all your files if it isn&#8217;t done uploading them. Did you check the log files?

### Comment by Tristan on 2018-10-28 09:43:28 -0400
I haven&#8217;t checked the log files yet, I didn&#8217;t specify a log file when I ran the command and I&#8217;m having some trouble finding if and where default logs are stored. I am going to try to run another full backup with &#8211;log-file. Why did you decide to use rclone instead?

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2018-10-30 14:55:51 -0400
Check out <a href="https://loganmarchione.com/2018/06/rclone-on-odroid-hc2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this</a> post.

> I ended up choosing rclone for this task, instead of Duplicity. Duplicity is great, but it requires a good bit of memory to run, and it writes temporary files to local storage while it encrypts and uploads them. Because the ODROID-HC2 has limited hardware, I didn’t want this to become a problem. As far as I can tell, rclone doesn’t have these problems or limitations. In addition, this backup is really a backup of a backup, so I’m just interested in pushing large amounts of data offsite as quickly as possible, which rclone seems to be suited for.

### Comment by Tristan on 2018-10-30 21:42:11 -0400
I will give it a read. I ran a full backup again with a log file and Info level verbosity. I guess . I should have used Debug. I grepped the logs for errors but only found matches within file names. Both runs have had this output:

But when using list-current-files b2://[my info] I get this output:  
Last full backup date: none

Maybe it would be easier to switch to rclone anyway.

Ya sorry, I&#8217;m probably not going to be much help here. You could try to search/open a bug on Launchpad if you&#8217;re using Ubuntu.

I think Duplicity provides more secure encryption with GPG (as compared to rclone), but to me, it seemed that overhead was too much.
