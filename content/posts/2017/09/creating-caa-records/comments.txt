Hi Logan,

I&#8217;ve been enjoying your posts. Thank you for taking the time to help folks like me!

One note on this post that I discovered while trying to copy what you did at HE: the first and third Type &#8216;CAA Record&#8221; screenshots all duplicates. The third should be (I think) the ioref screenshot.

I could not have done this without your help. Thank you again!

Yep, nice catch, thanks! I corrected this.
