Can you give a recipe for setting up VLANs between an EdgeRouter Lite and an EdgeSwitch Lite? Each VLAN will have it&#8217;s own DHCP server within the EdgeRouter. We have this configured, but can&#8217;t get traffic on the tagged ports pf the switch&#8230; missing some config on the router, and not sure what.

I actually haven&#8217;t setup any VLANs yet, sorry!

Hey there. This is by far the most well written guide for getting familiar with the ERL and command line interface! I&#8217;m and ERL noob and am excited to dig in to your guides! 

That said, (total rookie question), when i connect via putty and run the SHOW command, I can tab complete only to the following options: firewall interfaces port-forward services system.

So I can&#8217;t run the SHOW VERSION for example. I know I am missing something obvious. Is it because I am connected via putty and not directly to the device? Keep in mind this device has already been configured via GUI. 

Thanks again for these great writeups!

Thanks, glad to help!

You&#8217;re in &#8220;configure&#8221; mode (see the &#8220;edit&#8221; above the prompt).  
`[edit]<br />
ubnt@erl# show<br />
firewall      interfaces    port-forward  service       system`

Type `exit` to get back to normal mode, then retry your tab completion.

Thanks for the write-up &#8211; very useful. I thought I&#8217;d point out that (at least as of v1.9.1) under &#8220;Verify Hardware Offload&#8221;, you go into configure mode before running the &#8220;show ubnt offload&#8221; cmd. This doesn&#8217;t work &#8211; that command, which shows what is actually active, should be run outside of configure mode. To see what is configured, use &#8220;show system offload&#8221; inside configuration mode. See <a href="https://community.ubnt.com/t5/EdgeMAX/Difference-Between-show-ubnt-offload-and-show-system-offload/m-p/1790494#M143726" rel="nofollow ugc">https://community.ubnt.com/t5/EdgeMAX/Difference-Between-show-ubnt-offload-and-show-system-offload/m-p/1790494#M143726</a> for more info, but the following transcript illustrates:

user@erl:~$ show ubnt offload

Thanks, I updated the post to remove &#8220;configure&#8221;!

In the Setup Interfaces &#8211; Setup DHCP server for eth1, you show &#8220;LAN subnet 10.10.2.1/24&#8221;. Shouldn&#8217;t this be 10.10.2.0/24 for the subnet?

configure  
set service dhcp-server disabled false  
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN authoritative enable  
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN subnet 10.10.2.1/24 start 10.10.2.100 stop 10.10.2.199  
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN subnet 10.10.2.1/24 default-router 10.10.2.1  
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN subnet 10.10.2.1/24 dns-server 10.10.2.1  
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN subnet 10.10.2.1/24 lease 86400

Hmm, it seems you are right. According to <a href="https://help.ubnt.com/hc/en-us/articles/204952254-EdgeRouter-Configure-DHCP-server-on-EdgeRouter" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this doc</a>, it&#8217;s .0, not .1. Not sure how I missed that. However, my configuration is currently working with .1, so I&#8217;m going to have to go back and change it and see what breaks. Thanks for spotting that!

I have configured my router to use OpenNIC DNS servers. One of them has been taken off line so I need to delete it and add another.

Is this the correct syntax to delete a server?

configure  
delete service dns forwarding name-server xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx  
commit  
save

Yep!  
Try &#8220;compare&#8221; to see the changes before you &#8220;commit&#8221;. It will show you additions (+) or subtractions (-).  
If you don&#8217;t like what you did, you can &#8220;exit discard&#8221; to discard any changes instead of committing them.

### Comment by wd on 2017-08-14 16:43:09 -0400
Thanks, I&#8217;ll give that a try.

These write ups are very helpful, thanks.  
From my limited understanding of subnet nomenclature, the /24 means the first 24 bits (the 10.10.2 part) specify the subnet and therefore the last 8 bits (the .0 or .1 up to .255) can change.  
Conceivably, any number from 0 to 255 could work there. If you specify more bits for the subnet (say /30) then youâ€™re only left with 2 bits so only 0 to 3 would be valid.  
Of course this is entirely a thought experiment. ðŸ™‚

Dude!!! 2020 here!! This was GREAT! I literally bought my router 6 hours ago because the thing I was originally trying to buy at a store wasn&#8217;t able to be found (some small POE switch). I had researched my endgame though and it was this line of stuff and I found this router at like $60 off as an open box clearance. LOL! I can see how someone expecting an easy router config would be returning this, so unless it was actually some undiscovered hardware failure (It&#8217;s Microcenter, so they are actually pretty good at figuring out if it is customer-induced or actually a hardware issue), I could also return it AND make sure it never got back into stock. Anyway&#8230;

I&#8217;m in IT, but in Security. Did a fair share of Cisco IOS in the past, but new is new&#8230; This little thing you did here was a great gateway to how this line works. My needs were mostly just routing internal networks back to my internal router network that is hosting for my AT&T gateway. Basically, one interface on my current network and another network that can get DHCP for its network and route DNS back to the main router. I only needed the first half of this guide, modified for my needs where applicable. And, success!!!

I also noticed that I can directly mod the /config/config.boot using vi bypassing the [edit] shell altogether It requires a manual reboot of the service and a whole lot of trust in yourself &#8211; so not recommended for general folks, but saves a lot of typing when you know exactly what you are doing (and triple check if these are in a critical location). 

Anyway, this got me introduced into the ecosystem and got me running fast!!!!! Thank you for that time years ago documenting this for the internet!
