Controller alternatives:

5. Run the controller on an always-on PC server on your local network. Use dynamic DNS to access your controller from anywhere.

Also, both your screenshots look like they&#8217;re on 2.4GHz.

### Comment by Logan on 2016-12-06 15:25:54 -0500
Yep, that works just as well! Thanks for that, I updated the screenshots.

Great walk-through, thanks for taking the time. For anyone looking to get going with UniFi v5, simply change the first line from stable to unifi 5:

echo &#8220;deb <a href="http://www.ubnt.com/downloads/unifi/debian" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.ubnt.com/downloads/unifi/debian</a> unifi5 ubiquiti&#8221; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/100-ubnt.list

Thanks for this tip, I updated the post!

I&#8217;d like to mention that this worked for a RPi 2 setup as well.

### Comment by Logan on 2017-01-17 08:25:44 -0500
Good to know, thanks!

### Comment by Fernando on 2017-03-08 07:55:54 -0500
I have sucessfully built this using a RPi3 and it works great. However, everytime the Pi reboots I have to login on the browser in order to have Cloud Access. Is there a way I can have automatic login? This device won&#8217;t have any ports open to WAN except for the black magic Cloud Key uses.

### Comment by Amit on 2017-03-11 07:56:42 -0500
Is there a way to install the controller&#8217;s .deb file from a local folder or a server that I own and not from Ubiquity&#8217;s server?  
I will download the .deb file from Ubiquity prior to the installation.

### Comment by Logan on 2017-03-12 18:46:10 -0400
I&#8217;m confused on what you&#8217;re asking. Are you trying to setup your own repo? Or `wget` the file and then `dpkg -i` it?

### Comment by Logan on 2017-03-12 19:01:28 -0400
Sorry, I don&#8217;t have cloud access setup. I&#8217;d ask on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubiquiti/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">r/Ubiquiti</a> or the <a href="https://community.ubnt.com/t5/EdgeMAX/bd-p/EdgeMAX" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EdgeMax forums</a>.

Hey Folks,

I&#8217;m a long ways away from Linux/Debian guru status, and ran into a problem when I ran apt-get update . . . 

Anyone have any idea as to what would cause this error?  
Given that its worked for everyone else, I&#8217;m guessing the repo is fine . . .

E: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.

Note: I&#8217;ve tried both stable and unifi5.

### Comment by Robert on 2017-03-19 05:09:09 -0400
Hi Logan,

tried your guide an lowefamily.com.au guide on a Pi3. Everything installs fine. But unifi server won&#8217;t start. With netstat I can see there&#8217;s no open port 8443 and with ps aux | grep uni I couldn&#8217;t find a process like unifi. Any idea?

Robert

### Comment by Logan on 2017-03-20 14:27:19 -0400
Did you start the Unifi service?  
`sudo systemctl enable unifi<br />
sudo systemctl start unifi`

What does the status tell you?  
`sudo systemctl status unifi`

### Comment by Logan on 2017-03-20 14:30:30 -0400
What does your repo file look like? Mine looks like this&#8230;  
`deb http://www.ubnt.com/downloads/unifi/debian unifi5 ubiquiti`

### Comment by Jordan on 2017-03-20 16:02:36 -0400
Hi Logan,

Thanks for getting back to me.  
Think we&#8217;re about in sync. Mine came from a direct copy/paste from your notes.

deb <a href="http://www.ubnt.com/downloads/unifi/debian" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.ubnt.com/downloads/unifi/debian</a> stable ubiquiti

I&#8217;m not sure how to view what the response looks like and I get a 404 when trying to traverse to the file in my browser.

### Comment by Jordan on 2017-03-20 16:06:51 -0400
Just in case it matters:

This is a Pine64 (AllWinner 4xA53) running DietPi (light weight Debian Jessie distribution). Not an rpi3, but same instruction set, and I (mistakenly?) thought Jessie is Jessie.

### Comment by Logan on 2017-03-20 16:09:26 -0400
Are you running this on a Raspberry Pi 3 running Raspbian? It&#8217;s looking for `arm64` packages, when it should only be using `arm`.

### Comment by Logan on 2017-03-20 16:13:55 -0400
Just saw this. I believe the RPi3 and Raspbian are 32bit OSes, not 64. I think you need either a 64bit package, or to compile Unifi from source&#8230;

### Comment by Jordan on 2017-03-21 01:12:09 -0400
Hey Logan,

Did some checking and found a number of successful aarch64 installs.  
Which isn&#8217;t to say that something hasn&#8217;t gone sideways with the 64bit release. 

For anyone else they may be running into this, I created an entry at the ubiquity forum:  
<a href="https://community.ubnt.com/t5/UniFi-Wireless/apt-get-Unable-to-find-expected-entry-ubiquiti-binary-arm64/m-p/1871093#U1871093" rel="nofollow ugc">https://community.ubnt.com/t5/UniFi-Wireless/apt-get-Unable-to-find-expected-entry-ubiquiti-binary-arm64/m-p/1871093#U1871093</a>

### Comment by Logan on 2017-03-21 10:55:20 -0400
Because I don&#8217;t have the hardware to test, I&#8217;d say the best place to ask is on the EdgeMax forums, which you already did.

The first link seems to be what you&#8217;re looking for. There is a tutorial at the end (<a href="https://ishwestscriptwault.wordpress.com/2016/12/29/running-unifi-controller-5-on-pine64-en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>) that might be worth looking at.  
The second link (DietPi) works because he&#8217;s running it on a Raspberry Pi, which is 32bit.

### Comment by Jordan on 2017-03-23 23:05:40 -0400
Hi Logan,

Just a helpful bit for your readers . . . 

64bit is definitely unsupported.

If you don&#8217;t mind including the link, Ubiquiti&#8217;s official response / explination here:  
<a href="https://community.ubnt.com/t5/UniFi-Wireless/apt-get-Unable-to-find-expected-entry-ubiquiti-binary-arm64/m-p/1875673#M219083" rel="nofollow ugc">https://community.ubnt.com/t5/UniFi-Wireless/apt-get-Unable-to-find-expected-entry-ubiquiti-binary-arm64/m-p/1875673#M219083</a>

### Comment by Adam on 2017-04-18 19:41:20 -0400
Great article.  
I&#8217;ve already got an always on RPi 2 running an OSMC media centre.  
I&#8217;ve successfully installed it on that &#8211; I&#8217;ve not tried watching anything yet though, so yet to see how well they (osmc and the controller) really get on together. The UniFi web site seems to run OK though.

### Comment by Logan on 2017-04-21 12:55:35 -0400
Thanks, good to hear! Let me know how it performs!

### Comment by Matt on 2017-05-29 23:29:24 -0400
Thanks for putting this together. And to make it future installs easier, I adapted your instructions into an Ansible playbook:

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2017-05-30 08:20:29 -0400
Thanks! I&#8217;ve been trying to use Ansible more, this is a great place to start!

### Comment by Neil on 2017-08-17 06:37:43 -0400
Hi thanks for this awsome how to.. got an RPI3 up and running in minutes!  
One question though, I have connected to t with my browser and all looks good but its says it an&#8217;t find any devices.  
On my test network I have a Unifi AC LR that is managed by another controller but shouldn&#8217;t it still show up?

Cheers.

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2017-08-17 09:05:18 -0400
To be honest, I&#8217;m not sure if an AP can be adopted by more than one controller. I would think you&#8217;re not seeing it because it&#8217;s already managed&#8230;

### Comment by John Angelini on 2017-09-09 21:08:08 -0400
sudo systemctl disable mongodb

not 

sudo service mongodb disable

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2017-09-09 22:20:42 -0400
Corrected, thanks!

### Comment by Eric on 2017-09-10 13:17:35 -0400
Good article. This helped me get my RPi 3 running fast. Only issue I ran into and not part of your instructions. I moved a backup of my config from controller on Mac Laptop to the RPi. I needed to SSH into each of the APs and issue this command: set-inform <a href="http://10.100.0.100:8080/inform" rel="nofollow ugc">http://10.100.0.100:8080/inform</a>. 10.100.0.100 is the IP of the RPi. This was needed because all the AP&#8217;s detected as Detached.

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2017-09-11 19:41:14 -0400
Didn&#8217;t know that was needed when migrating, thanks!

After trying multiple guides and reading a lot of positive comments here I tought this was really going to work, but unfortunately I cannot login to the webinterface.

When I check the status it says its active (sudo systemctl status unifi)

Any suggestions? I&#8217;m running this next to domoticz, which is on port 8080

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2017-09-24 21:18:07 -0400
According to <a href="https://help.ubnt.com/hc/en-us/articles/218506997-UniFi-Ports-Used" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this</a>, UniFi needs port 8080. Try checking <a href="https://help.ubnt.com/hc/en-us/articles/204910084-UniFi-Change-Default-Ports-for-Controller-and-UAPs" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this</a> to change the default ports.

Also, try to tail the UniFi logs out (as root).  
`tail -f /usr/lib/unifi/logs/server.log`

### Comment by Maikel on 2017-09-26 12:08:21 -0400
After a few restarts, domotics was not working anymore and at that moment I tried to open the unifi site and it was working!. So this confirmed to me that there was a port conflict. I changed the domoticz ports and now both are working.

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2017-09-26 12:57:42 -0400
Glad it was an easy fix!

### Comment by Oz on 2017-10-04 09:04:36 -0400
Hi.

When I try the key, it says this: gpg: keyserver receive failed: No dirmngr

What is wrong?  
Thanks.

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2017-10-04 09:14:27 -0400
I think you need to install the <a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/dirmngr" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dirmngr</a> package  
`sudo apt-get install dirmngr`

### Comment by Oz on 2017-10-04 09:15:48 -0400
Nevermind. 

I just installed the dirmngr and it worked. Thanks.

### Comment by Oz on 2017-10-04 09:16:17 -0400
Thanks. I havent seen this. That fixed it.

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2017-10-04 09:20:27 -0400
Glad it worked!

### Comment by Oz on 2017-10-04 10:01:20 -0400
Logan,

If I turn the raspberry off, will I have to &#8220;systemctl start unifi&#8221; again? Is there any way to set it on startup?

I&#8217;m a newbbie on Linux.  
Thanks.

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2017-10-04 10:18:35 -0400
This will start unifi once&#8230;  
`sudo systemctl start unifi`

This will start unifi at boot&#8230;  
`sudo systemctl enable unifi`

### Comment by poeske887 on 2018-05-26 08:05:48 -0400
works exellent thx

### Comment by weust on 2018-09-27 08:19:05 -0400
Since this article is almost two years old, are the performance issues with Java still present?  
As in, is it still better to use oracle-jdk instead of open-jdk?

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2018-09-27 09:35:50 -0400
You&#8217;re probably better off asking on the <a href="https://community.ubnt.com/t5/UniFi-Wireless/bd-p/UniFi" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UniFi forums</a>. I&#8217;m now using OpenJDK, but the controller is running on an x86 machine now, not a RPi3.

### Comment by Kevin D Boutelle on 2020-03-01 13:39:12 -0500
I ran into an issue on a Raspberry Pi 4 where I could not get Oracle java 8 installed (using the latest version of Raspbian as I write this). The error was that there was no installation candidate. So I used this site (<a href="https://openjdk.java.net/install/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://openjdk.java.net/install/</a>) and installed version 8. Then I used your tip on changing the version (alternates) to change to the openjdk 8 version of Java. This worked and my controller is now installed and running fine. 

Thank you for this writeup it was immensely helpful in getting me started.

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2020-03-02 10:58:58 -0500
Glad you&#8217;re using OpenJDK. I don&#8217;t typically update my articles when things change (otherwise, this entire site would need to be rewritten), but I went back and removed my recommendation for Oracle Java.

Oracle started charging for Oracle Java back in 2019, so I now recommend you stick with OpenJDK. It is open-source and performs much better than it used to.
