I&#8217;m following this closely as I am also looking to move away from Ubiquiti. It one broken promise after another with them. I used pfsense years ago and then monowall, but I&#8217;m a bit out of practice. I&#8217;m going to spin up a VM on my ESXi box this week to re-educate myself. 

I have a USG4, Cloud Key (Gen 1), and ERL-3 already on the eBay chopping block. Totally fed up w/ Ubiqiti and I&#8217;m not alone. 

Good luck and I look forward to more updates on your progress.

I highly recommend pfSense. However, Ubiquiti still makes the best consumer APs, so I haven&#8217;t replace those (yet). Not sure if you saw, but there&#8217;s a <a href="https://loganmarchione.com/2019/08/pfsense-on-the-pc-engines-apu2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">newer post</a> than this one where I installed pfSense on an APU2, I highly recommend that little device.

I just bought SG 1100 (received it yesterday), and I have now configured it and are ready to replace my EdgeRouter Lite (3 ports). I noticed yesterday that SG 1100 was very warm when I only managed the box from web UI (no traffic). Do you recommend me to stop replacing my old EdgeRouter and refund my SG 1100 due to hardware problems?

No way to know until you try. I would check the CPU temperature on the pfSense web UI and see how that compares to others online.
