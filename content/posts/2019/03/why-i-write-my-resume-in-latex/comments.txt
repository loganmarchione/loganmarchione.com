I&#8217;ve been making my resume / CV in latex since university. Treating your resume like source in a version control system is huge. Impossible to do with word. And the output is just beautiful. Having latex as a skill with some proof in the reviewer&#8217;s hands is a big plus too. Biggest disadvantage: spell check.

Yes, I agree! I think a few GUI editors have spell check built-in, but I&#8217;m not sure about command-line use.

I use Vim as my text editor and it has spell check. But regrettably Vim is not easy to master and definitely is not useful for everybody&#8230; It also requires careful configuration to be really useful.

Vim definitely has a steep learning curve, but it&#8217;s worth it once you get there!

Its really not that steep, just need to sit down and start doing it. Just remember, whenever you think &#8220;there&#8217;s gotta be a faster way&#8221; while using Vim, there probably is, just have to look it up!
