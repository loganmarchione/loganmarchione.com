Exactly what I was looking for! Thanks for putting this together. Like yourself, just looking for a single-drive backup solution. I will be adding NextCloud and Plex to this equation after following this guide. Also, great external links to support. I priced this out at several vendors and AmeriDroid seems to be the least expensive option, still. I will get started with this as soon as it arrives.

This is a great tutorial! My HC2 is up and running. Thank you!

Glad it&#8217;s working!

Glad I was able to help!

FYI &#8211; I don&#8217;t run Plex on the HC2 itself, I run Plex inside a VM on a different machine and only use the HC2 as storage for Plex. I&#8217;m not sure what kind of transcoding the HC2 would be capable of.

Issue I have notice with HC2 and OMV is that if you remove the HDD (partitioned/formatted/ with data) and try to read it on another Linux desktop (e.g. Mint) none of the created partitions w/ data exist. Don&#8217;t understand why. SO if your HC2 with die there is no way to get the data.

I&#8217;ll have to test this myself, but do you have a non-standard setup with your HC2? Not using RAID or anything weird? You&#8217;d think you&#8217;d able to just pull the drive and all the data should be on standard Linux partitions.

Thanks for posting!!

Interesting approach. 

Couple of Qs; 

Since posting, any updates or changes to approach / HW etc ?

In your post you say&#8221;I chose the HC2, which is only a single-drive device, because I‚Äôm not looking for a 2-bay NAS with RAID support. &#8221; What option might you suggest for a 2 bay / RAID setup.

Thanks again !!!

Nope, been running OMV4 since this post, but I see that OMV5 is in beta. However, my 4TB drive is 93% full so I‚Äôm going to be upgrading.

This time, I am going for a 2-bay NAS appliance. I‚Äôll probably end up with the Synology DS718+. It has a decent CPU and upgradable RAM. Synology recently refreshed their product line, but the 2-bay NAS appliances didn‚Äôt get a refresh. QNAP, Buffalo, and Asus also make storage devices, but Synology is considered the ‚Äúbest‚Äù.

Hi!  
Can you say temperature your HC2(HDD) in use?  
You do something for vibration reduction and cooling your device?

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2019-10-17 09:08:07 -0400
When it&#8217;s really running, it gets up to about 60 C, but when it&#8217;s idle it sits around 40-45 C. That&#8217;s the temperature as reported by Armbian (which I think is the CPU temperature, I don&#8217;t measure the temperature of the HDD itself).

No, I don&#8217;t do anything for vibration or cooling. However, I considered getting one of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ARCTIC-Breeze-Mobile-Flexible-Portable/dp/B003XN24GY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">these</a>, but never got around to it.

Hi, how did you know how to access the web interface after you boot OMV for the first time?

### Comment by Logan Marchione on 2020-01-06 10:38:04 -0500
The web interface is at the IP of your device (e.g., <a href="http://192.168.1.10" rel="nofollow ugc">http://192.168.1.10</a>).

Hi, I came across this post while doing my research on Odroid HC2, very detailed and a lot of information for somebody like me that is trying to decide on the product. 

From their website I notice that, you can stack multiple boards and was wondering if you need to expand why don&#8217;t you add on a second board+drive and continue to expand as required in the future? Something like this &#8211; <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/06/14/neat-odroid-glusterfs-build-stashes-data-sips-power/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://hackaday.com/2018/06/14/neat-odroid-glusterfs-build-stashes-data-sips-power/</a>

I am trying to understand if there is a drawback to the device or something that you have observed that would make you want to move to Synology instead.

Thank you

Good question! Lots of people stack HC2 units (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/f68qpb/meet_the_new_low_power_minilab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc">here&#8217;s a recent example</a>), but that wasn&#8217;t going to work long-term for me. I had a couple things pushing me towards a Synology (I ended up with a DS718+ with 2x8TB WD Reds).  
1) Adding an additional HC2 would be another Linux distribution to setup/manage/patch. In addition, those MicroSD cards aren&#8217;t known to be super-durable in the long-term.  
&#8212;Synology solves this by having their OS installed onto each drive of the device.  
2) There is no (easy) way to expand storage. If I needed to replace a 4TB drive with an 8TB drive, it would require me to buy a new drive and manually copy all the contents to the new drive. I suppose I could use something like GlusterFS, but that would require buying another HC2 and drive, setting up an OS, setting up GlusterFS, etc&#8230;  
&#8212;Synology solves this with RAID. If I want to upgrade a drive, I can hot-swap it and RAID will rebuild the new (empty) drive from the existing drive.

For me, I realized I would spend more time managing/maintaining the HC2 units than actually using them, so I opted for an &#8220;appliance&#8221; like the Synology.

Very helpful guide, just got my HC2 and set it up üôÇ

Glad to help! If you haven&#8217;t seen oDroid now has an HC4 which is a toaster-style two-drive unit.
