# About donations...

This is a bit of an awkward topic. Over the years, I've had enough people ask me if I accept donations that I thought it would be best to make a quick reference page about it.

While offering to donate to me is flattering and humbling, I have to decline. Instead, I think you should donate to organizations, developers, and projects that have a _real_ impact on open source software. In most cases, I'm standing on the shoulders of giants and simply repackaging or repurposing existing software. I believe that you should be donating to _those_ projects, not mine.

You can view my public contributions below. These are the organizations, developers, and projects that I really enjoy (in no particular order). Use them as inspiration.

## Ads/sponsorship

As-of 2022-02-07, I am a verified [Brave Creator](https://creators.brave.com/). If you use the [Brave browser](https://brave.com/), you can send me a tip in [BAT](https://basicattentiontoken.org/). Being part of the Brave Creator program doesn't inject anything into the traffic between my site and your browser, it simply gives you the option to send me BAT (and if you're not using Brave, none of this applies to you).

I don't accept sponsors or free items in exchange for review.
