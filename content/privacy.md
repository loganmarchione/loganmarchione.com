# Introduction

This policy is subject to change without notice and was last updated on 2023-05-01.

# Who I am

This is my personal site, the address is [https://loganmarchione.com](https://loganmarchione.com).

My opinions are my own, and do not reflect those of any current or previous employers, groups, or organizations.

# What personal data I collect and why I collect it

I use your information only for providing and improving this site.

## Analytics

As-of 2021-03-01, I use [Plausible](https://plausible.io) for analytics. Information about Plausible's privacy features are located [here](https://plausible.io/data-policy). Visitors to my site should be aware of a few things:

- I only use your information to determine what posts are more popular, what day/time is best to post, how long you stay on my site, etc…
- Plausible collects minimal data by design. They only collect:
  - Page URL
  - HTTP Referer
  - Browser (derived from the User-Agent HTTP header)
  - Operating system (derived from the User-Agent HTTP header)
  - Device type
  - Visitor Country (after the geolocation lookup is completed, your IP is discarded and is never stored in their database or logs)
- Plausible uses JavaScript for the tracking tag. Because of this, you can use [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock), [NoScript](http://noscript.net/), or [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/en/download) to block JavaScript on my site (this might make some pages display/behave in unintended ways).
- Plausible is [open source](https://plausible.io/open-source-website-analytics) with their code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/plausible/analytics/).

# Contact

If there’s anything else you’d like to know about how I use your information or the security of this site, please [contact](/contact) me.
