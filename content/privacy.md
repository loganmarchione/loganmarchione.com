# Introduction

This policy is subject to change without notice and was last updated on 2022-02-07.

# Who I am

This is my personal site, the address is [https://loganmarchione.com](https://loganmarchione.com).

My opinions are my own, and do not reflect those of any current or previous employers, groups, or organizations.

# What personal data I collect and why I collect it

I use your information only for providing and improving this site.

## Analytics

As-of 2021-03-01, I use [Plausible](https://plausible.io) for analytics. Information about Plausible's privacy features are located [here](https://plausible.io/data-policy). Visitors to my site should be aware of a few things:

- I only use your information to determine what posts are more popular, what day/time is best to post, how long you stay on my site, etc…
- Plausible collects minimal data by design. They only collect:
  - Page URL
  - HTTP Referer
  - Browser (derived from the User-Agent HTTP header)
  - Operating system (derived from the User-Agent HTTP header)
  - Device type
  - Visitor Country (after the geolocation lookup is completed, your IP is discarded and is never stored in their database or logs)
- Plausible uses JavaScript for the tracking tag. Because of this, you can use [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock), [NoScript](http://noscript.net/), or [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/en/download) to block JavaScript on my site (this might make some pages display/behave in unintended ways).
- Plausible is [open source](https://plausible.io/open-source-website-analytics) with their code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/plausible/analytics/).

## Ads/sponsorship

As-of 2022-02-07, I am a verified [Brave Creator](https://creators.brave.com/). If you use the [Brave browser](https://brave.com/), you can send me a tip in [BAT](https://basicattentiontoken.org/). Being part of the Brave Creator program doesn't inject anything into the traffic between my site and your browser, it simply gives you the option to send me BAT (and if you're not using Brave, none of this applies to you).

I don't accept sponsors or free items in exchange for review.

If there’s anything else you’d like to know about how I use your information or the security of this site, please [contact](/contact) me.
