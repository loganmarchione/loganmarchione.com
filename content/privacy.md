# Introduction

This policy is subject to change without notice and was last updated on 2021-02-22.

# Who I am

This is my personal website, the address is [https://loganmarchione.com](https://loganmarchione.com).

My posts and ideas are my own, and do not reflect opinions of my current or previous employers.

# What personal data I collect and why I collect it

I use your information only for providing and improving this site.

## Comments

When visitors leave a comment on this site, I collect the data shown in the comments form, as well as the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent (UA) string to help spam detection. Comments are checked for spam with [Akisment](https://akismet.com/). The Akisment service privacy policy is available [here](https://automattic.com/privacy/).

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so I can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/) service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available [here](https://automattic.com/privacy/). After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

## Media

If you upload images to the website, or include links to images, you should avoid uploading/linking images with embedded location data (e.g., EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.

## Cookies

If you leave a comment on this site, you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year, but can be deleted by you, from your browser’s settings, at any time.

Articles on this site may link to other websites, or include embedded content (e.g., videos, images, etc…). Both links and embedded content behave in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website, and as such, I cannot control the privacy or security of that content or be held responsible for that content. These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

# Your data rights

You can request to receive an exported file of the personal data I hold about you, including any data you have provided to me. You can also request that I erase any personal data I hold about you. This does not include any data I am obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.

# Analytics

As-of 2020-04-20, I use [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) for analytics. Information about Matomo’s privacy features are located [here](https://matomo.org/privacy/). Visitors should be aware of a few things:

*   I host my own Matomo instance. Your data never leaves my server.
*   I only use your information to determine what posts are more popular, what day/time is best to post, how long you stay on my site, etc…
*   Matomo anonymizes your data, including your IP address and Matomo user ID.
*   Matomo uses your IP address to determine your location. This information is provided through a database by [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home) called [GeoLite2 City](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/), which provides your coarse location (city/state/country). The MaxMind privacy policy is available [here](https://www.maxmind.com/en/privacy_policy).
*   Matomo uses JavaScript for the tracking tag. Because of this, you can use [NoScript](http://noscript.net/) or [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/en/download) to block JavaScript on my site (this might make some pages display/behave in unintended ways).
*   Matomo is also set to fully support your browser’s [Do Not Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) setting.
